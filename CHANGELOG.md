# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Breaking changes marked with a :boom:

## [0.18.0] - 2022-02-10

### Bug Fixes

- :boom: Improve failure details ([#467](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/467))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Most `failure.message` fields are no longer prefixed with `'Error: '`, so places in which you're checking `failure.message === 'Error: a message'` likely need to be changed to `failure.message === 'a message'`.

- [`workflow`] Fix startChild options type ([#447](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/447))
- [`workflow`] Fix error when timer is cancelled and immediately fired in the same activation ([#466](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/466))

### Features

- Replay history from files ([#449](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/449))
  - Provides a way to exercise existing histories against local workflow code
- [`core`] Make Core portable ([#458](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/458))
- Accept IHistory for history replay ([#460](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/460))
- [`client`] Use `runId` only in handles created with `getHandle` ([#468](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/468))
  - In addition:
    - Adds safety to `terminate` and `cancel` so handles created with `start` can't accidentally affect workflows that are not part of the same execution chain
    - Adds optional `firstExecutionRunId` param to `getHandle` for added safety
  - Closes [#464](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/464)
  - Closes [#377](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/377)
  - Closes [#365](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/365)

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Handle proto renaming / repackaging updates from core ([#446](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/446))
- Add MakeOptional and Replace type helpers ([#401](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/401))
- Fix core-bridge main entry in package.json ([#463](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/463))

## [0.17.2] - 2021-12-28

### Bug Fixes

- Reverted ([#430](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/430)) which added protobuf payload converters

  This broke Workflows for some users who had the `assert` package installed in their `node_modules` folder.
  `proto3-json-serializer` (added in this PR) requires `assert` which transitively requires `utils` which relies on `process` being available.

## [0.17.1] - 2021-12-27

### Bug Fixes

- Fix Workflow retryable `ApplicationFailure` fails execution ([#432](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/432))

  - Makes `ApplicationFailure.retryable` fail the workflow execution and not the task as intended, this was wrongly implemented in [#429](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/429).

- Update core submodule to receive recent bugfixes ([#433](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/433))
  - Fix WFT failures sometimes getting stuck in a spam loop ([sdk-core#240](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/240))
  - Move warning message for failed activations to be only during reports ([sdk-core#242](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/242))
  - Fix double-application of an empty WFT when handling legacy queries ([sdk-core#244](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/244))

### Features

- Add Protobuf binary and JSON data converter and WorkerOptions.dataConverterPath ([#430](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/430))

  - Renamed `WorkerOptions.dataConverter` to `WorkerOptions.dataConverterPath`: path to a module with `dataConverter` named export. This is needed in order to get the run the data converter in the node worker thread.
  - Added `ProtobufBinaryDataConverter` `ProtobufJsonDataConverter` that convert protobufjs JSON modules based arguments and return types to and from Payloads.

  **IMPORTANT**:

  Workflow cannot deserialize protobuf messages yet as it still uses the default data converter - the ability to customize the workflow data converter is coming soon.

  Design notes:

  https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/docs/protobuf-libraries.md

  Other notes:

  - Other SDKs, can read protobuf payloads generated by the TypeScript SDK
  - Other SDKs, when protobuf-serializing, must include the name of the class in `payload.metadata.messageType` for the TS SDK to read
    - **This has not been implmented yet**
    - Will later be used by the UI

## [0.17.0] - 2021-12-17

### Bug Fixes

- Use bundled Workflow interceptors ([#427](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/427))

  Addresses issue [#390](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/390) where workflow interceptor modules might not be present when using pre-bundled workflow code.

### Features

- :boom: Add validation to retry policy and use a TS friendly interface everywhere ([#426](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/426))

  - `RetryOptions` was renamed `RetryPolicy`
  - client `WorkflowOptions` no longer accepts protobuf `retryPolicy` instead it has a TS `RetryPolicy` `retry` attribute

- Implement async Activity completion ([#428](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/428))

  - Activity can throw [`CompleteAsyncError`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.completeasyncerror/) to ask the worker to forget about it
  - Later on the [`AsyncCompletionClient`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.asynccompletionclient/) can be used to complete that activity

- [`workflow`] Handle unhandled rejections in workflow code ([#415](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/415))

  - Associate unhandled rejections from workflow code to a specific runId.
  - Makes the unhandled rejection behavior consistent between node 14 and 16 and propagates failure back to the user.
    Previously, in node 16 the process would crash and in node 14 we would incorrectly ignore rejections leading to unexpected workflow behavior.

- :boom: [`workflow`] Make random workflow errors retryable ([#429](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/429))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Before this change throwing an error in a Workflow
  would cause the Workflow execution to fail. After the change only the
  Workflow task fails on random errors.
  To fail the Workflow exection throw `ApplicationFailure.nonRetryable`.

  To make other error types non retryable use the
  `WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor` `execute` and `handleSignal` methods
  to catch errors thrown from the Workflow and convert them to non
  retryable failures, e.g:

  ```ts
  class WorkflowErrorInterceptor implements WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor {
    async execute(
      input: WorkflowExecuteInput,
      next: Next<WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor, 'execute'>
    ): Promise<unknown> {
      try {
        return await next(input);
      } catch (err) {
        if (err instanceof MySpecialNonRetryableError) {
          throw ApplicationFailure.nonRetryable(err.message, 'MySpecialNonRetryableError');
        }
        throw err;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  NOTE: Propagated Activity and child Workflow failures are considered non
  retryable and will fail the workflow execution.

## [0.16.4] - 2021-12-08

### Bug Fixes

- Update core to fix workflow semaphore not released on cache miss ([#424](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/424))

### Features

- Default `WorkflowHandle` generic T param to `Workflow` ([#419](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/419))

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Add comments for unused query and signal generics ([#402](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/402))
- [`docs`] Expose worker.CoreOptions ([#416](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/416))
- [`docs`] Expose BundleOptions and remove `__namedParameters` ([#404](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/404))

- Remove proto usage from workflow runtime ([#423](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/423))

  This is now possible because we're using vm instead of isolated-vm.

  - Greatly reduce workflow bundle size - SDK test bundle size went down from 2.77MB to 0.73MB
  - Step 1 in supporting custom data converter

### Testing

- Ignore github actions jobs that require secrets for external committers ([#414](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/414))

## [0.16.3] - 2021-11-29

### Bug Fixes

- [`workflow`] Fix argument wrapping in array when signaling from Workflow ([#410](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/410))

  Before this fix, signal arguments sent from a workflow would be wrapped in an array, e.g:

  ```ts
  await child.signal(someSignal, 1, '2');
  ```

  Was received in the child workflow as:

  ```ts
  wf.setHandler(someSignal, (num: number, str: string) => {
    console.log(num, str); // [1, '2'] undefined
  });
  ```

- [`core`] Upgrade Core to receive fixes to activity heartbeats ([#411](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/411))

  - Fix hang in case Activity completes after heartbeat response indicates Activity timed out.

  - Behavior was incorrect and not inline with the other SDKs.
    Heartbeats are now throttled using a timer and Core does not count on user to keep sending heartbeats in order flush them out.

    Added 2 new `WorkerOption`s to control throttling:

    - `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval`
    - `defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval`

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- [`docs`] Explain that getHandle doesn't validate workflowId ([#400](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/400))

- Don't use fs-extra in create-project ([#412](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/412))

  Fixes issue where fs-extra is incompatible with ESM as reported on slack.

## [0.16.2] - 2021-11-23 - beta

### Features

- [`worker`] Add `WorkerOptions.debugMode` to enable debugging Workflows ([#398](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/398))

## [0.16.1] - 2021-11-22 - beta-rc.1

### Features

- [`create-project`] Use chalk-template instead of chalk-cli ([#396](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/396))
  - Fixes issues where `npx @temporalio/create` fails to resolve the `chalk` executable

## [0.16.0] - 2021-11-19 - beta-rc.0

### Bug Fixes

- [`core`] Update Core w/ specifying queue kind on polling ([#389](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/389))

  - Must be specified for optimization reasons on server

- [`core`] Update Core to receive bugfixes ([#391](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/391))

  - Fix a situation where Core could get stuck polling if WFTs were repeatedly being failed
  - Do not fail Workflow if Lang (TypeScript) cancels something that's already completed (e.g. activity, timer, child workflow)
  - Fix for Core accidentally still sending commands sometimes for things that were cancelled immediately

### Features

- :boom: [`client`] Make `workflowId` required ([#387](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/387))

  Also remove `WorkflowClientOptions.workflowDefaults`.

  Reasoning:

  - Workflow IDs should represent a meaningful business ID
  - Workflow IDs can be used as an idempotency key when starting workflows from an external signal
  - `workflowDefaults` were removed because their presence made `taskQueue` optional in `WorkflowOptions`, omitting it from both the defaults and options resulted in runtime errors where we could have caught those at compile time.

  Migration:

  ```ts
  // Before
  const client = new WorkflowClient(conn.service, { workflowDefaults: { taskQueue: 'example' } });
  const handle = await client.start(myWorkflow, { args: [foo, bar] });
  // After
  const client = new WorkflowClient(conn.service);
  const handle = await client.start(myWorkflow, {
    args: [foo, bar],
    taskQueue: 'example',
    workflowId: 'a-meaningful-business-id',
  });
  ```

- Support Windows development ([#385](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/385))

  - Support was added for using and developing the SDK on Windows
  - Thanks @cons0l3 and @cretz for the contribution

- [`workflow`] Use vm instead of isolated-vm ([#264](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/264))

  - Removes the `node-gyp` dependency and speeds up installation times
  - Uses Node's built-in `AsyncLocalStorage` implementation instead of our own
  - :boom: Requires an additional workflow interceptor if using `@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry`

  ```ts
  import { WorkflowInterceptors } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import {
    OpenTelemetryInboundInterceptor,
    OpenTelemetryOutboundInterceptor,
    OpenTelemetryInternalsInterceptor,
  } from '@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry/lib/workflow';

  export const interceptors = (): WorkflowInterceptors => ({
    inbound: [new OpenTelemetryInboundInterceptor()],
    outbound: [new OpenTelemetryOutboundInterceptor()],
    // Disposes of the internal AsyncLocalStorage used for
    // the otel workflow context manager.
    internals: [new OpenTelemetryInternalsInterceptor()], // <-- new
  });
  ```

  - Unexpose the `isolatePoolSize` and `isolateExecutionTimeout` `WorkerOptions`

## [0.15.0] - 2021-11-11

### Bug Fixes

- Fix type imports ([#361](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/361))

- Update core, changes for no more WF update errors ([#366](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/366))

  Failing a Workflow task before this change could put the workflow in a stuck state.

- :boom: [`workflow`] Throw if patches are used at Workflow top level ([#369](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/369))
- :boom: [`workflow`] Cancel timer created by condition ([#372](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/372))

  Also clean up resources taken by the blocked condition.<br>
  **This change is incompatible with old Workflow histories**.

- :boom: [`workflow`] Ensure signals are always processed ([#380](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/380))

  This fixes a critical issue where the SDK was not processing history events in the right order, for example, patches and signals should always be delivered before other events in the context of a single Workflow Task.

  **This change is incompatible with old Workflow histories**.

### Features

- :boom: [`workflow`] Change condition parameter order ([#371](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/371))

  ```ts
  // Before
  const conditionIsTrue = await condition('1s', () => someBooleanVariable);
  // After
  const conditionIsTrue = await condition(() => someBooleanVariable, '1s');
  ```

- :boom: Rename ExternalDependencies to Sinks ([#370](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/370))
- Support complication on Mac for aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu ([#378](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/378))

## [0.14.0] - 2021-11-03

### Bug Fixes

- Add missing index.d.ts to published files in core-bridge package ([#347](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/347))
- [`docs`] Update algolia index name ([#350](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/350))
- [`core`] Update core to gain infinite poll retries ([#355](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/355))
- [`worker`] Fix Worker possible hang after graceful shutdown period expires ([#356](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/356))

### Features

- :boom: [`workflow`] Rename `createActivityHandle` to `proxyActivities` ([#351](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/351))
- The function's usage remains the same, only the name was changed.

  Before:

  ```ts
  import { createActivityHandle } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import type * as activities from './activities';

  const { greet } = createActivityHandle<typeof activities>({
    startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  import { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import type * as activities from './activities';

  const { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
    startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
  });
  ```

  Reasoning:

  - Clarify that the method returns a proxy
  - Avoid confusion with `WorkflowHandle`

- :boom: [`workflow`] Rename `setListener` to `setHandler` ([#352](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/352))

  BREAKING CHANGE: The function's usage remains the same, only the name was changed.

  Before:

  ```ts
  import { defineSignal, setListener, condition } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import { unblockSignal } from './definitions';

  export const unblockSignal = defineSignal('unblock');

  export async function myWorkflow() {
    let isBlocked = true;
    setListener(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));
    await condition(() => !isBlocked);
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  import { defineSignal, setHandler, condition } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import { unblockSignal } from './definitions';

  export const unblockSignal = defineSignal('unblock');

  export async function myWorkflow() {
    let isBlocked = true;
    setHandler(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));
    await condition(() => !isBlocked);
  }
  ```

  Reasoning:

  - It was our go-to name initially but we decided against it when to avoid confusion with the `WorkflowHandle` concept
  - Handling seems more accurate about what the function is doing than listening
  - With listeners it sounds like you can set multiple listeners, and handler doesn't

- [`worker`] Add SIGUSR2 to default list of shutdown signals ([#346](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/346))
- :boom: [`client`] Use failure classes for WorkflowClient errors

  - Error handling for `WorkflowClient` and `WorkflowHandle` `execute` and `result` methods now throw
    `WorkflowFailedError` with the specific `TemporalFailure` as the cause.
    The following error classes were renamed:

    - `WorkflowExecutionFailedError` was renamed `WorkflowFailedError`.
    - `WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNewError` was renamed
      `WorkflowContinuedAsNewError`.

  Before:

  ```ts
  try {
    await WorkflowClient.execute(myWorkflow, { taskQueue: 'example' });
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof WorkflowExecutionFailedError && err.cause instanceof ApplicationFailure) {
      console.log('Workflow failed');
    } else if (err instanceof WorkflowExecutionTimedOutError) {
      console.log('Workflow timed out');
    } else if (err instanceof WorkflowExecutionTerminatedError) {
      console.log('Workflow terminated');
    } else if (err instanceof WorkflowExecutionCancelledError) {
      console.log('Workflow cancelled');
    }
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  try {
    await WorkflowClient.execute(myWorkflow, { taskQueue: 'example' });
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof WorkflowFailedError) {
    ) {
      if (err.cause instanceof ApplicationFailure) {
        console.log('Workflow failed');
      } else if (err.cause instanceof TimeoutFailure) {
        console.log('Workflow timed out');
      } else if (err.cause instanceof TerminatedFailure) {
        console.log('Workflow terminated');
      } else if (err.cause instanceof CancelledFailure) {
        console.log('Workflow cancelled');
      }
  }
  ```

## [0.13.0] - 2021-10-29

  - :boom: Make `makeWorkflowExporter` resource param required
  - Fix Workflow span timestamps
  - Disable internal SDK tracing by default
  - Connect child workflow traces to their parent
  - Connect continueAsNew traces
  - Add activity type and workflow type to span names and copy format from Java SDK
  - :boom: Some breaking changes were made to the interceptor interfaces
    - `workflowType` input attribute is now consistently called `workflowType`
  - Change trace header name for compatibility with Go and Java tracing implementations

### Features

- Support bundling Workflow code prior to Worker creation ([#336](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/336))
- :boom: Refactor WorkflowHandle creation ([#343](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/343))

  - `WorkflowClient.start` now returns a `WorkflowHandle`
  - `WorkflowHandle` no longer has `start`, `signalWithStart` and
    `execute` methods
  - `WorkflowClient.signalWithStart` was added
  - To get a handle to an existing Workflow use `WorkflowClient.getHandle`
  - `wf.createChildWorklowHandle` was renamed to `wf.startChild` and
    immediately starts the Workflow
  - `wf.executeChild` replaces `ChildWorkflowHandle.execute`
  - `wf.createExternalWorkflowHandle` was renamed to
    `wf.getExternalWorkflowHandle`

- Enhance `@temporalio/create` and use samples-node as its source ([#273](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/273))
- :boom:[`core`] Change `WARNING` log level to `WARN`
- Add Core option to forward logs from Rust to configurable Node logger
- [`workflow`] Support `ms` formatted strings in sleep() function
- :boom:[`worker`] Remove `workDir` Worker option

  Activities and Workflows are not automatically detected
  anymore. `nodeModulesPath` has been renamed `nodeModulesPaths` to
  support resolution from multiple `node_modules` paths, the Worker will
  attempt to autodiscover `node_modules` based on provided
  `workflowsPath`.

- [`workflow`] Provide better error message when calling createChildWorkflowHandle on unregistered workflow
- :boom:[`client`] Switch parameter order in WorkflowClient.execute and start methods
- [`workflow`] Add condition helper function
- Link Node / Core and `interceptors/opentelemetry` generated spans together
- :boom:[`workflow`] Implement Workflow API 3rd revision ([#292](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/292))

  All existing Workflows need to be rewritten in the new form:

  ```ts
  import * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';

  export const unblockSignal = wf.defineSignal('unblock');
  export const isBlockedQuery = wf.defineQuery<boolean>('isBlocked');

  export async function myWorkflow(arg1: number, arg2: string): Promise<void> {
    let isBlocked = true;
    wf.setListener(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));
    wf.setListener(isBlockedQuery, () => isBlocked);
    await wf.condition(() => !isBlocked);
  }
  ```

  See the [proposal](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/pull/44) for more information.

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Remove port bindings from buildkite docker compose file
- Remove unneeded bit of protection around shutdown now that core handles it
- Reuse loaded package.json for ServerOptions.sdkVersion
- Initial nightly long run implementation
- Print error with traceback when promise hook fails
- Pass client/version info to core, work with new options builders
- Properly set otel context when calling into core
- Handle scenario where worker is totally removed before calling next poll
- Don't log empty metadata
