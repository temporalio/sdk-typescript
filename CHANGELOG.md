# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Breaking changes marked with a :boom:

## [1.8.2] - 2023-08-02

### Features

- [`workflow`] Add support for URL/URLSearchParams inside the workflow sandbox ([#1173](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1173))

- [`worker`] Export the `WorkerStatus` interface ([#1184](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1184)).

### Bug Fixes

- Use custom symbol-based implementation of `instanceof` for all of our custom error classes ([#1166](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1166)).
  This is a complete rework of the fixes introduced in 1.8.0 and 1.8.1, both of which turned out to be insufficients.
  `instanceof` now works correctly both accross execution contexts and when running tests with Jest.

  :boom: The static `is`
  function introduced previously on some of our error classes is no longer required, as the `instanceof` operator itself
  now behave correctly; these `is` functions have therefore been removed.

- [`client`] Make `action.workflowId` optional on Schedule update ([#1176](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1176))

- [`activity`] `heartbeatTimeoutMs` is now correctly set on Activity's `Context.current().info`. The
  `currentAttemptScheduledTimestampMs` property has also been added to that data structure ([#1187](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1187))

- [`workflow`] The Workflow Bundler is now smarter regarding requiring files with incorrect or missing file extensions ([#1186](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1186)). Thanks to [`@GauBen`](https://github.com/GauBen) 🙏.

- [`workflow`] Fix incorrect values of `workflowInfo.historyLength` and `workflowInfo.unsafe.isReplaying` as reported in
  out-of-sandbox log messages, and as argument of sink function implementations ([#1181](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1181)).

- [`workflow`] Sink functions configured with `callDuringReplay = false` are no longer invoked from a replay-only worker
  (ie. `Worker.runReplayHistories()`); it was previously possible for these to get called in some cases on the very last
  WFT ([#1181](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1181)).

- [`workflow`] Encoding and decoding of protobuf JSON payloads is now working in workflow context. This was previously
  failing, due to the fact that an underlying library depends on the `Buffer` class, which is not available inside the
  workflow sandbox ([#1170](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1170)). Thanks to [`@antlai-temporal`](https://github.com/antlai-temporal) 🙏.

- [`core`] Improve warning message on error response to completion ([temporalio/sdk-core#581](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/581))
  Thanks to [`@dandavison`](https://github.com/dandavison) 🙏.

- [`core`] Fix abandoned children nondeterminism if they complete ([temporalio/sdk-core#580](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/580)).

## [1.8.1] - 2023-07-07

### Bug Fixes

- Remove instanceof Error checks from `is` methods ([#1162](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1162)).
  This fixes various regressions observed when running Workflow tests with Jest.

- Add the `VersioningIntent` parameters on the experiemental [worker versioning](https://docs.temporal.io/workers#worker-versioning)
  feature ([#1156](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1156)). Also, all values of the `ReachabilityType`
  type has been converted to SCREAMING_CASE.

- [`workflow`] Make `workflows.log()`'s `attributes` argument optional ([#1159](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1159)).

- [`workflow`] Attach `workflows.log()`'s `attributes` to every workflow log message ([#1159](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1159)).

## [1.8.0] - 2023-06-29

### Features

- [`worker`] Add support for [worker versioning](https://docs.temporal.io/workers#worker-versioning) ([#1146](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1146)).

  Worker versioning is available from server version 1.21 (if enabled in dynamic configuration).

  :warning: Experimental - While the feature is well tested and is considered functionally stable, the SDK APIs are
  considered experimental.

  To use worker versioning with the TypeScript SDK, use the following steps:

  ```ts
  import { Client } from '@temporalio/client';
  import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';

  const buildId = 'id-generated-from-continuous-integration';

  // Deploy new workers, opt them in to versioning.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    buildId,
    useVersioning: true,
    // ...
  });

  // ...

  // In a separate process, when all workers are up, update the build id compatibility for the task queue.
  const client = new Client({
    /* options */
  });
  // If the current version is incompatible with the previous ones:
  await client.taskQueue.updateBuildIdCompatibility('my-task-queue', {
    operation: 'addNewIdInNewDefaultSet',
    buildId,
  });
  // Or, if the current version is compatible with a previous one:
  await client.taskQueue.updateBuildIdCompatibility('my-task-queue', {
    operation: 'addNewCompatibleVersion',
    buildId,
    existingCompatibleBuildId: 'some-other-build-id',
  });

  // Check if workers are reachable before retiring them (even if their build ids are associated with multiple task
  // queues):
  const { buildIdReachability } = await client.taskQueue.getReachability({ buildIds: ['some-other-build-id'] });
  const { taskQueueReachability } = buildIdReachability['some-other-build-id'];
  for (const [taskQueue, reachability] of Object.entries(taskQueueReachability)) {
    if (reachability.length > 0) {
      if (reachability[0] === 'NotFetched') {
        // We asked the server for too many reachability entries (build ids or task queues),
        // This build id / task queue reachability should be fetched in another request.
        // Fetch this information here or later...
      } else {
        console.log('Build id still reachable on:', taskQueue);
      }
    }
  }
  // Check if build id is reachable...
  ```

- [`worker`] Add support for using multiple concurrent pollers to fetch Workflow Tasks and Activity Tasks from Task Queues
  ([#1132](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1132)).

  The number of pollers for each type can be controlled through the `WorkerOptions.maxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPolls`
  and `WorkerOptions.maxConcurrentActivityTaskPolls` properties. Properly adjusting these values should allow better
  filling of the corresponding execution slots, which may signficiantly improve a Worker's throughput. Defaults are
  10 Workflow Task Pollers and 2 Activity Task Pollers; we however strongly recommend tuning these values
  based on workload specific performance tests.

  Default value for `maxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutions` has also been reduced to 40 (it was previously 100), as recent
  performance tests demonstrate that higher values increase the risk of Workflow Task Timeouts unless other options are
  also tuned. This was not problem previously because the single poller was unlikely to fill all execution slots, so
  maximum would rarely be reached.

- [`workflow`] The `reuseV8Context` worker option is no longer marked as experimental ([#1132](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1132)).
  This is a major optimization of the Workflow sandboxing runtime; it allows the worker to reuse a single execution
  context across Workflow instances, without compromising the safety of the deterministic sandbox. It significantly
  reduces RAM and CPU usage. The formula used to auto-configure `maxCachedWorkflows` has also been reviewed to reflect a
  lower memory usage requirement when `reuseV8Context` is enabled.

  At this point, you still need to opt-in to this feature by adding `reuseV8Context: true` to your `WorkerOptions`, as
  we believe most teams should reconsider their workers's performance settings after enabling this option.

  :boom: Note that we are planing enabling this option by default starting with 1.9.0. If for some reason, you prefer to
  delay enabling this optimization, then we recommend that you explicitly add `reuseV8Context: false` to your worker
  options.

- We now provide out-of-the-box log support from both Workflows and Activity contexts ([#1117](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1117), [#1138](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1138))).

  For Workflows, the logger funnels messages through the `defaultWorkerLogger` sink, which itself defaults to forwarding
  messages to `Runtime.instance().logger`.

  Example usage:

  ```ts
  import * as workflow from '@temporalio/workflow';

  export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
    workflow.log.info('hello from my workflow', { key: 'value' });
  }
  ```

  For Activities, the logger can be accessed as `Context.log`. It defaults to `Runtime.instance().logger`, but may be
  overriden by interceptors (ie. to set a custom logger). `ActivityInboundLogInterceptor` is still installed by default,
  adding enriched metadata from activity context on each log entry.

  Example usage:

  ```ts
  import * as activity from '@temporalio/activity';

  export async function myActivity(): Promise<void> {
    const context = activity.Context.current();
    context.log.info('hello from my activity', { key: 'value' });
  }
  ```

- :boom: Protect against 'ms' durations errors ([#1136](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1136)).
  There have been several reports of situations where invalid durations resulted in unexpected and hard to diagnose
  issues (e.g. can you can predict what `const bool = condition(fn, '1 month')` will do?). We now provide type
  definitions for "ms-formated strings" through the newly introduced `Duration` type, which is either a well formed
  `ms`-formated string or a number of milliseconds. Invalid ms-formated-strings will also throw at runtime.

  Note: this might cause build errors in situations where a non-const string value is passed somewhere we expect a
  `Duration`. Consider either validating and converting these strings _before_ passing them as `Duration`, or simply
  cast them to `Duration` and deal with runtime exception that might be thrown if an invalid value is provided.

- [`workflow`] Clone sink args at call time on Node 17+
  ([#1118](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1118)). A subtle aspect of Workflow Sinks is that calls
  are actually buffered and get executed only once the current Workflow activation completes. That sometime caused
  unexpected behavior where an object passed as argument to a sink function is mutated after the invocation.

  On Node.js 17+, we now clone sink arguments at call time, using `structuredClone`. While this adds some runtime
  overhead, it leads to more predictable experience, as well as better exceptions when passing non-transferrable objects
  to a sink.

- [`core`] Add the `sticky_cache_total_forced_eviction` metric ([Core #569](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/569))

- [`client`] Throw more specific errors from Client APIs ([#1147](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1147))

### Bug Fixes

- [`core`] Metrics that should be produced by the SDK Core's internal Client would previously not
  get emited. This has been fixed. ([#1119](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1119))
- [`client`] Fix incorrect schedule spec boundaries checks on hour and day of month ([#1120](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1120))
- [`workflow`] We now throw more meaningful errors when Workflow-only APIs are used from
  non-Workflow context, and some other situations. ([#1126](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1126))
- Removed most `instanceof` checks from SDK, and remplaced them by `XxxError.is(...)` checks, based on the presence of
  a symbol property. We believe this should help resolve most of the problems that previously been observed when
  multiple copies or different versions of SDK packages are installed in a same project (([#1128](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1128))).
- [`workflow`] Make Local Activily timeouts in `ActivityInfo` match those of non-Local Activities ([#1133](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1133), [Core #569](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/569)).
- [`workflow`] Ensure payload converters keep Uint8Array type equality ([#1143](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1133))
- Fail workflow task if local activity not registered with worker ([#1152](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1152))
- [`core`] Don't increment terminal command metrics when replaying ([Core #572](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/572))
- [`core`] Fix start-to-close local activity timeouts not being retryable like they should be ([#Core 576](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/576))

## [1.7.2] - 2023-04-14

### Bug Fixes

- [`core`] Fix scenario where server sends page token pointing to empty page [#533](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/533)
- [`core`] Fix internal flags not always being written when they should be [#532](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/532)

- [`core`] Get rid of leftover warning log line [#530](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/530)

## [1.7.1] - 2023-04-13

### Features

- [`core`] Allow overriding origin for core connections [#528](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/528)

  Setting `serverNameOverride` in `NativeConnection.tls` will now also set the `:authority` header.

### Bug Fixes

- [`core`] Avoid possible panic on autocompleting WFTs due to failure, and stop checking SA values for determinism [#527](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/527)

## [1.7.0] - 2023-04-02

### Features

- :boom: [`worker`] The experimental `Worker.runReplayHistories` method, which allows efficient replay of a large number
  of workflow histories, now returns an `AsyncIterableIterator` ([#1067](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1067))

  **EXAMPLE USAGE**

  ```ts
  const histories = client.workflow.list({ query: 'WorkflowType="MyWorkflow"' }).intoHistories({ concurrency: 10 });
  const replayResults = Worker.runReplayHistories(
    {
      workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
      // ...
    },
    histories
  );
  for await (const result of replayResults) {
    const { workflowId, runId, error } = result;
    // error is either undefined, a ReplayError, or a DeterminismViolationError
  }
  ```

- :boom: [`worker`] `WorkerOptions.shutdownGraceTime` no longer forcefully shuts the worker down. Now, when `shutdownGraceTime` passes, the worker just sends Cancellation to running Activities.
  Set `WorkerOptions.shutdownForceTime` to force shutdown. ([#1072](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1072))

- :boom: [`testing`] Use [Temporal CLI](https://github.com/temporalio/cli/#temporal-cli) to power local test environment ([#1077](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1077))

### Bug Fixes

- Fail Workflow on `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError` ([#1068](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1068))

- [`create-project`] While fixing dependencies on a newly instantiated project, we now recursively search for
  package.json and tsconfig.json ([#1089](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1089) thanks to [`@jhubbardsf`](https://github.com/jhubbardsf) 🙏)

- [`create-project`] Remove the `.post-create` file (if it exists), before committing to git ([#1018](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1018))

- :boom: Completetly removed support for Node versions <= 14.17. Lot of our dependencies were already
  requiring Node 14.18+ anyway. ([#1070](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1070))

- Load package `abort-controller` as a polyfill rather than a complete substitution.
  This will ensure using native implementation of that class in Node 16+ ([#1070](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1070))

  :boom: This change might cause TypeScript to warn about incompatible types when working with libraries that are using
  custom type definitions for the `AbortSignal` interface.

  ```ts
  import type { AbortSignal as FetchAbortSignal } from 'node-fetch/externals';
  // ...
  const response = await fetch(url, { signal: Context.current().cancellationSignal as FetchAbortSignal });
  ```

- [`client`] Get rid of experimental `AsyncLocalStorage.enterWith` call ([#1080](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1080))

- [`core`] Fix slot metrics appearing to be off-by-one because of reservation ([#479](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/479))

- [`core`] Fix misnamed metric `workflow_task_execution_failed` ([#481](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/481))

- [`core`] Added an internal patching mechanism for adjusting SDK behavior based on what version of the SDK has previously processed the workflow. Note that this new mechanism requires server Temporal 1.20.0 or above. Any change that depends on such an internal patch will not be effective with older servers. ([#482](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/482))

- :boom: [`core`] Make activity (and child workflow) type / id mismatches will results in a non-deterministic change. That means that renaming an activity or a child workflow will now require a patch. Note that this change has been gated with an internal patch to avoid suddently failing with nondeterminism errors on older activity rename (see details above) ([#475](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/475), [#482](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/482))

- [`core`] Auto-fail new workflow tasks which encounter a problem upon their application, but before any activation has been issued to lang. This may fix some scenarios where previously a WFT would simply time out. ([#482](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/482))

### Documentation

- Add install protocal buffers step to CONTRIBUTING.md doc ([#1086](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1086), thanks to [`@jhubbardsf`](https://github.com/jhubbardsf) 🙏)

## [1.6.0] - 2023-01-30

### Features

- [`workflow`] (Experimental) Introduced a major optimization to the workflow runtime ([#951](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/951)).

  This optimization allows the worker to reuse execution context across workflows, without compromising the safety of the deterministic sandbox. Some initial performance tests have demonstrated reduction of RAM usage by as much as 66%, and reduction of CPU usage by up to 50%.

  To enable this feature, add `reuseV8Context: true` to your `WorkerOptions`.

- [`workflow`] Added `workflowInfo().startTime` and `workflowInfo().runStartTime`. ([#1031](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1031))

- [`workflow`] Added support for default workflow handlers ([#1038](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1038)).

  A workflow bundle may opt-in to receive requests for non-registered workflow types by exporting a default function:

  ```ts
  export default async function (...args: unknown[]): Promise<unknown> {
    const { workflowType } = workflowInfo();
    // ...
  }
  ```

- [`workflow`] Added support for default signal handlers ([#1038](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1038)).

  A workflow function may opt-in to receive requests for non-registered signals with:

  ```ts
  setDefaultSignalHandler((signalName: string, ...args: unknown[]) => {
    // ...
  });
  ```

- [`worker`] It is now possible to launch workers in debug mode by setting environment variable `TEMPORAL_DEBUG=true` ([#1031](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1031)).

### Bug Fixes

- A recent release of `@grpc/grpc-js` has been causing multiple issues:

  - [10 seconds timeout on process exit](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1023),
  - [process crashing unexplainedly](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1033),
  - "Failed to connect before deadline" errors, and more.

  We pinned our dependencies on `@grpc/grpc-js` to `1.7.3` ([#1025](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1025)). This pin will be removed once we confirm that the upstream project is stable again for our usage.

- [`client`] Multiple small changes to the experimental Schedules API. ([#1028](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1028), [#1032](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1032), [#1009](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1009))

- [`workflow`] `instanceof` on `WorkflowInfo` fields now works as expected ([#1031](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1031), [#659](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/659))

- [`create-project`] `create-project` now works correctly on Node 18 ([#995](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/995))

- [`core`] Fixed incorrect calculation of schedule-to-start timeouts on local activities ([#450](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/450)).

- [`core`] Fixed some rare case where sdk-core would panic on unexpected history fetching responses from the server ([#468](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/468)).

- [`core`] Fixed some rare case where an activation completion might get blocked if fetching history pages failed ([#478](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/478)).

## [1.5.2] - 2022-12-07

### Bug fixes

- [`core`] Use correct property name for OTel metrics export interval in core-bridge ([#993](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/993)).

## [1.5.0] - 2022-12-07

### Features

- [`client`] The experimental `WorkflowHandle.fetchHistory` function can now be used to easily obtain a single
  Workflow execution's history ([#974](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/974)).

- [`client`] Introduced (experimental) high level API to list workflows ([#942](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/942),
  [#974](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/974)):

  ```ts
  for await (const workflowInfo of client.workflow.list({ query: 'WorkflowType="MySuperCoolWorkflow"' })) {
    console.log(`${workflowInfo.workflowId} ${workflowInfo.runId}`);
  }
  ```

  The same API can also be used to efficiently obtain a list of workflows histories. Multiple histories are fetched from
  the server in parallel (up to `concurrency`, defaults to 5), which may improve performances.

  ```ts
  for await (const { workflowId, history } of client.workflow.list().intoHistories({ concurrency: 10 })) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

- [`client`] Added (experimental) high level API to work with Schedules ([#937](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/937),
  [#960](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/960)):

  ```ts
  // Define a schedule that will start workflow 'RefreshClientTableWorkflow` every day at 5 AM and 1 PM
  await client.schedule.create({
    scheduleId: `refresh-client-table-every-morning`,
    spec: {
      calendars: [{ hour: [5, 13] }],
    },
    action: {
      type: 'startWorkflow',
      workflowType: 'RefreshClientTableWorkflow',
      taskQueue,
    },
  });
  ```

  Note that Schedules requires Temporal version 1.18 or later.

- [`core`] Core's (experimental) telemetry options are now more configurable ([#963](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/963),
  [#977](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/977)). Notably, filters can now be specified independently
  for `logging` (applicable to both `console` and `forward` loggers) and `tracing`. Function `makeTelemetryFilterString`
  can be used to easily build filter strings. Also, OTel metrics export interval can now be modified (defaults to 1
  second).

  Note: the `TelemetryOptions` interface has changed quite a bit. Using appropriate new options is highly recommended.
  Backward compatibility for legacy options is provided, to the extent possible, but these legacy options have been
  deprecated.

- [`client`] WorkflowClient now supports a simpler way to define interceptors ([#956](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/956)).
  Interceptors should now be provided as an array of interceptor object, rather than an array of factory to those
  objects under a field named `calls`. Former definition syntax is still supported, though deprecated.

  **BEFORE**

  ```ts
    interceptors: {
      calls: [
        (workflowId) => {
          create(...) => { ... }
        }
      ]
    }
  ```

  **AFTER**

  ```ts
    interceptors: [
      {
        create(...) => { ... }
      }
    ]
  ```

- [`worker`] Introduced an experimental API to efficiently replay a large number of workflow histories. Teams may
  notably use this API to validate that changes to their workflow code will not cause non-determinism errors on existing
  workflow instances, before rolling out these changes to production ([#920](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/920),
  [#974](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/974)).

  **EXAMPLE USAGE**

  ```ts
  const histories = client.workflow.list({ query: 'WorkflowType="MyWorkflow"' }).intoHistories({ concurrency: 10 });
  const replayResults = await Worker.runReplayHistories(
    {
      workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
      // ...
    },
    histories
  );
  console.log(`Found ${replayResults.errors.length} replay errors`);
  ```

- Added `activity_task_received` metric ([#439](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/439))

### Bug Fixes

- [`workflow`] Don't fail workflow task if a query handler was not found ([#932](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/932)).

- [`worker`] Wait for worker shutdown if `runUntil` promise throws ([#943](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/943)).
  Previously, `Worker.runUntil` would not wait for worker to complete its shutdown if the inner `fnOrPromise` threw an
  error. Now, it will always wait for both worker shutdown AND the inner `fnOrPromise` to resolve. If either one throw
  an error, then that error is rethrown. If _both_ throw an error, a `CombinedWorkerRunError` will be thrown instead,
  with a `cause` attribute containing both errors.

- The (experimental) `FailureConverter` type now receives its `PayloadConverter` through an argument on convertion
  methods, rather than through an option supplied at construction time ([#936](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/936)).
  This provides a more predictable behaviour in the common case of using the default failure converter. More over,
  `FailureConverter.errorToFailure` function's return type has been lossen, so that it supports greater customization on
  user side ([#927](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/927))

- [`client`] `ConnectionOptions.connectTimeout` is now being applied correctly ([#954](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/954)).

- [`workflow`] Properly encode memos in `makeContinueAsNewFunc` ([#955](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/955)).
  They were previously not encoded at all, resulting in a failure due to invalid data.

- [`worker`] Activity metric `scheduled_to_start_latency` now reports the time from the schedule time of the
  _current attempt_ to the start time of that same attempt, instead of the time elapsed since the initial schedule time
  ([#975](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/975)). This new definition aligns with other SDKs and is
  more useful from a monitoring perspective.

- [`workflow`] Previously, `condition(fn, 0)` was incorrectly handled the same as `condition(fn)`, meaning that the
  function would block indefinitely and would return nothing once `fn` evaluated to true. It now behaves the same as
  `condition(fn, 1)`, ie. the function will sleep for a very short time, then return true if `fn` evaluates to true,
  or false if timeout reaches its expiration ([#985](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/985)).

- [`core`] Fixed some non-deterministic behaviour in workflows containing local activities, due to heartbeats
  being incorrectly counted as logical workflow tasks ([#987](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/987)).

- [`core`] `core-bridge` has been refactored so that it does not retain static references to custom TypeScript error
  constructors ([#983](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/983)). This change is part of an ongoing effort
  to resolve multiple issues observed by some users in execution of their unit tests based on sdk-typescript, notably in
  conjunction with Jest, Mocha and Vitest.

- [`worker`] The default log function now write errors using `process.stderr.write` rather than `console.error`
  ([#940](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/940)). This avoids complains by some test runners.

- [`debugger`] Log errors comming from VS Code debugger ([#968](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/968))

- Bug Fixes in Core SDK:
  - Fixed a situation causing Core to send activations containing both a legacy query and other jobs ([#427](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/427))
  - Don't use a process-wide unique id for sticky queues ([#430](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/430))
  - Added support for ignorable history events ([#422](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/422))
  - Avoid hang in duplicated run-ids during replay ([#417](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/417))
  - Backoff more if we receive ResourceExhausted error ([#408](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/408))

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Improved code linting ([#771](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/771), thanks to [`@JounQin`](https://github.com/JounQin) 🙏)
- [`client`] Extract a BaseClient super class ([#957](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/957))

## [1.4.4] - 2022-11-03

### Bug Fixes

- Don't request eager activities when worker started with no remote activities

  Actual fix made in this Core SDK PR: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/429

## [1.4.3] - 2022-10-14

### Bug Fixes

- [`nyc-test-coverage`] Delay checking for **coverage** until helpers run because **coverage** is undefined when Jest
  starts ([#910](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/910))
- [`worker`] Avoid a race in shutdown hooks ([#918](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/918))
- [`core`] Ignore cancels of StartFailed state in child workflows, see: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/413

## [1.4.2] - 2022-10-06

### Bug Fixes

- [`client`] Fix default gRPC keepalive settings not applied
  ([#906](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/906))

## [1.4.1] - 2022-10-06

### Bug Fixes

- [`client`] Handle test server empty history when waiting for workflow result
  ([#902](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/902))
- [`common`] Export and deprecate error helpers ([#901](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/901))

  Fixes a breaking change accidentally introduces in 1.4.0 where some rarely used utility functions were deleted.

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Improve regex for extracting source map ([#899](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/899))

  Addresses reported issue by userr where regex caused `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` when parsing their
  workflow bundle.

## [1.4.0] - 2022-09-28

### Features

- :boom: Make client gRPC retry more configurable ([#879](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/879))

  BREAKING CHANGE: [`GrpcRetryOptions.retryableDecider`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.grpcretryoptions/#retryabledecider) now gets the `attempt` number as the first argument. This is an advanced/rare option, and the change should be caught at compile time.

  Also adds [`BackoffOptions`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.backoffoptions/) and [`defaultGrpcRetryOptions`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/client/#defaultgrpcretryoptions).

  NOTE: This feature is experimental and its API may change.

- [`client`] Delete search attributes with empty array values in describe() response ([#878](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/878))

  :warning: This fixes a bug where empty/deleted Custom Search Attributes were returned as `[]` from [`workflowHandle.describe()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.workflowhandle/#describe). Such attribute properties will no longer be present in the [`WorkflowExecutionDescription.searchAttributes`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowExecutionDescription#searchattributes) object. Note that this behavior is consistent with what you'll see if using a pre-1.4 version of the SDK with Server version 1.18.

- Add support for custom failure converters ([#887](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/887))

  Adds [`DataConverter.failureConverterPath`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.dataconverter/#failureconverterpath) and [`FailureConverter`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.FailureConverter), which converts from proto Failure instances to JS Errors and back.

  We recommended going with the default (i.e. not using the `failureConverterPath` option) in order to maintain cross-language Failure serialization compatibility.

  NOTE: This feature is experimental and its API may change.

- [`workflow`] Add [`workflowInfo().unsafe.now()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.UnsafeWorkflowInfo/#now) ([#882](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/882))

  It returns the current system time in milliseconds. The safe version of time is `new Date()` and `Date.now()`, which are set on the first invocation of a Workflow Task and stay constant for the duration of the Task and during replay.

- Upgrade core, add support for OTEL metric temporality ([#891](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/891))

  - Upgraded otel and other deps ([temporalio/sdk-core#402](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/402))
  - Fix incorrect string names for polling methods ([temporalio/sdk-core#401](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/401))

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Remove `internal-*` packages ([#881](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/881))

  :warning: Any imports from `@temporalio/internal-*` need to be updated. As noted in their named and READMEs, they're not meant to be used to directly, so we don't imagine this is a common case. However, if you do find instances, they should be changed to importing from:

  ```
  @temporalio/internal-non-workflow-common ➡️ @temporalio/common/lib/internal-non-workflow
  @temporalio/internal-workflow-common ➡️ @temporalio/common
  ```

- [`common`] Deprecate internal functions that should have never been exported ([#893](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/889))

  Some time-related and binary conversion internal helper functions were exported from `@temporalio/common`. They are now deprecated and hidden from the API reference, as they're meant for internal use only.

- [`workflow`] Export `LoggerSinks` from `@temporalio/workflow` ([#889](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/889))
- [`client`] Add [max retry interval](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.backoffoptions/#maxintervalms) for client ([#883](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/883))
- Label grpc-retry API as experimental ([#891](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/891))
- Make the failure-converter code symmetric ([#891](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/891))

### Bug Fixes

- Fix double import of long in generated proto TS files ([#891](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/891))
- Fix bundler with default workflow interceptors ([#891](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/891))
- Limit eager activity requests to 3 ([#891](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/891))

## [1.3.1] - 2022-10-10

### Bug Fixes

- Depend on `~1.3.1` of `@temporalio/*` packages to prevent `>= 1.4.0` versions from being installed.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-09-20

### Bug Fixes

- :boom: Various bug fixes ([#873](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/873))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Makes `WorkflowExecutionDescription.historyLength` a number. This was a `Long` before, but shouldn't
  have been. If you're currently calling:

  ```ts
  (await workflowHandle.describe()).historyLength.toNumber();
  ```

  then remove the `.toNumber()` call.

  This PR also included:

  - Make `protobufjs` a dev dependency of `@temporalio/client`
  - Use simple version of Core's `cancelChildWorkflowExecution` command

- :boom: Update Core from [`e261`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/tree/e261de3c38b47b29be0db209e9a4758250593034) to [`b437`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/tree/b437737) ([#865](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/865) and [#873](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/873))

  BREAKING CHANGE: This fixes a bug where values (memo, search attributes, and retry policy) were not being passed on to
  the next Run during Continue-As-New. Now they are, unless you specify different values when calling
  [`continueAsNew`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#continueasnew)
  ([temporalio/sdk-core#376](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/376)). _[We believe this is unlikely to break
  users code—the code would have to be depending on the absence of these values in Continued-As-New Runs.]_

  This update also have various fixes and features:

  - Don't dispatch eager activity if task queue is not the "current" ([temporalio/sdk-core#397](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/397))
  - Fix cancelling of started-but-lang-doesn't-know workflows ([temporalio/sdk-core#379](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/379))
  - Protect worker from more network errors ([temporalio/sdk-core#396](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/396))
  - Use tokio-rustls for request ([temporalio/sdk-core#395](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/395))
  - Fix for ephemeral test server zombie ([temporalio/sdk-core#392](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/392))
  - Ephemeral server lazy-downloader and runner ([temporalio/sdk-core#389](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/389))
  - Fix health service getter ([temporalio/sdk-core#387](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/387))
  - Expose HealthService ([temporalio/sdk-core#386](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/386))
  - Add more missing workflow options and add request_id as parameter for some calls ([temporalio/sdk-core#365](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/365))
  - Correct API definition link ([temporalio/sdk-core#381](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/381))
  - Add grpc health checking service/fns to client ([temporalio/sdk-core#377](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/377))
  - Respect per-call gRPC headers ([temporalio/sdk-core#375](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/375))
  - More client refactoring & add versioning-opt-in config flag ([temporalio/sdk-core#374](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/374))
  - Publicly expose the new client traits ([temporalio/sdk-core#371](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/371))
  - Add Test Server client & update deps ([temporalio/sdk-core#370](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/370))
  - Added test confirming act. w/o heartbeats times out ([temporalio/sdk-core#369](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/369))
  - Add Operator API machinery to client ([temporalio/sdk-core#366](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/366))

- [`client`] Only require `signalArgs` in [`signalWithStart`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.workflowclient/#signalwithstart) when needed ([#847](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/847))

### Features

- :boom: Improvements to `@temporalio/testing` ([#865](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/865) and [#873](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/873))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Breaking for the testing package in some of the more advanced and rarely used options:

  - No longer accepting `runInNormalTime` when waiting for workflow result
  - `TestWorkflowEnvironmentOptions` is completely redone

  _[Given that these were rarely used and the testing package isn't meant for production use, we don't think this change warrants a major version bump.]_

  `TestWorkflowEnvironment.create` is deprecated in favor of:

  - [`TestWorkflowEnvironment.createTimeSkipping`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#createtimeskipping)
  - [`TestWorkflowEnvironment.createLocal`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#createlocal)

  Added [`TestWorkflowEnvironment.currentTimeMs`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#currenttimems).

- Various minor features ([#865](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/865))
  - Add [`Connection.healthService`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Connection#healthservice) and generate testservice and health in proto package
  - Updated ci to use sdk-ci namespace for testing with cloud.
  - Use ephemeral server from Core (supports both time skipping and temporalite)
  - Test server is now only downloaded on first use
  - Removed some unused dependencies
  - Refactored core bridge into multiple files
  - Closes [#834](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/834)
  - Closes [#844](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/844)
- [`client`] Add a high-level meta [`Client`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Client) class ([#870](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/870))

  We now recommend using this instead of our other clients:

  ```ts
  import { Client } from '@temporalio/client';

  const client = new Client(options);

  await client.workflow.start();
  await client.activity.heartbeat();
  await client.activity.complete();
  ```

  - `client.workflow` is a [`WorkflowClient`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.workflowclient/).
  - `client.activity` is an [`AsyncCompletionClient`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.asynccompletionclient/).
  - We will be adding `client.schedule.*` (see the [`ScheduleClient` proposal](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/pull/62)).

- Add [`ActivityOptions.allowEagerDispatch`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.activityoptions/#alloweagerdispatch) (default true) ([#873](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/873))
- [`testing`] Use `temporal.download` for downloading test server ([#864](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/864))
- Add Webpack rule to auto instrument Workflows for code coverage, add `augmentWorkerOptions()` ([#858](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/858), thanks to [`@vkarpov15`](https://github.com/vkarpov15) 🙏)

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- In-process verdaccio server ([#861](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/861), thanks to [`@mjameswh`](https://github.com/mjameswh) 🙏)

## [1.2.0] - 2022-09-01

### Features

- [`client`] Enable gRPC keep-alive by default ([#855](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/855))
- Implement entrypoint for debug replayer ([#848](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/848))

### Bug Fixes

- [`workflow`] Fix non-determinism on replay when using a `patched` statement in a `condition` ([#859](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/859))
- `isCancellation` no longer scans chain recursively ([#837](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/837))
- Don't trigger conditions for query jobs ([#854](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/854))

- Update README badge links ([#856](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/856))

## [1.1.0] - 2022-08-20

### Bug Fixes

- :boom: [`worker`] Remove unnecessary `ReplayWorkerOptions` ([#816](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/816))

  BREAKING CHANGE: While this is technically breaking (if you pass options that are irrelevant to replay like `maxActivitiesPerSecond`, you'll get a compilation error), we decided it did not warrant a major version bump, as it doesn't affect production code (replay is a testing feature) and is only a type change (is caught at compile type by TS users and doesn't affect JS users).

- Warn instead of throwing when getting `workflowBundle` with `workflowsPath` and `bundlerOptions` ([#833](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/833))

  ⚠️ NOTE: We now prefer taking `workflowBundle` over `workflowsPath` when both are provided, which is the correct behavior and what users should expect.

  We also now warn that workflow interceptors are ignored when using `workflowBundle`.

- [`workflow`] Make breakpoints work inside workflow isolate context ([#819](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/819))

  ⚠️ NOTE: Bundles created with `bundleWorkflowCode` should only be used for calling `Worker.create` when the exact same version of `@temporalio/worker` is used. (If you don't pin to exact versions in your `package.json`, then you should use a lockfile, and both the machine that runs `bundleWorkflowCode` and `Worker.create` should run `npm ci`, not `npm install`.)

  ⚠️ DEPRECATION: `sourceMap` and `sourceMapPath` are now deprecated. We've inlined source maps, so now this works:

  ```ts
  const { code } = await bundleWorkflowCode({ workflowsPath });
  const worker = await Worker.create({ workflowBundle: { code }, ...otherOptions });
  ```

- Avoid using dynamic import in `@temporalio/testing` ([#805](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/805))
- [`worker`] Don't start activity poller if no activities registered ([#808](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/808))
- Update `proto3-json-serializer` to `^1.0.3` ([#809](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/809))
- Help protobufjs find `long` in Yarn3 ([#810](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/810)) ([#814](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/814))
- Add `@types/long` to client ([#735](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/735))
- [`worker`] Improve worker default options heuristics ([#802](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/802))
- Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `create-project` for CI ([#721](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/721))

### Features

- :boom: [`worker`] Add webpack configuration, closes [#537](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/537) ([#815](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/815))

  This was our most-upvoted feature request! ([9 👍's](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).) See [`WorkerOptions.bundlerOptions.webpackConfigHook`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.workeroptions/#bundleroptions) for usage.

  BREAKING CHANGE: If you provide both `workflowBundle` & `workflowsPath` or both `workflowBundle` & `bundlerOptions` to `Worker.create`, a `ValueError` will now be thrown. While this is technically breaking, TODO

- Add `@temporalio/nyc-test-coverage` package ([#798](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/798), thanks to [`@vkarpov15`](https://github.com/vkarpov15) 🙏)

  This package adds code coverage for Istanbul. It's currently in beta: the API may be unstable as we gather feedback on it from users. To try it out, see [this code snippet](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/798#issue-1323652976) for current usage.

- [`common`] Improve `ApplicationFailure` arguments; add `.create` and `.fromError` ([#767](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/767))

  See [`ApplicationFailure.create`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.applicationfailure/#create) and [`ApplicationFailure.fromError`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.applicationfailure/#fromerror)

- Expose additional console methods to workflow context ([#831](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/831))

  `console.[error|warn|info|debug]` can now be called from Workflow code, in addition to `console.log`

### Refactor

- :boom: [`workflow`] Move `TaskInfo` to `WorkflowInfo` ([#761](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/761))

  BREAKING CHANGE: There is no longer a `taskInfo()` export from `@temporalio/workflow`. `taskInfo().*` fields have been moved to `workflowInfo()`.

- :boom: Update `activity` and `worker` exports ([#764](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/764))

  BREAKING CHANGE: If you were importing any of the following errors from `@temporalio/activity` (unlikely), instead import from `@temporalio/common`: `ValueError, PayloadConverterError, IllegalStateError, WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError, WorkflowNotFoundError`

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2022-07-11

### Bug Fixes

- Ignore source map parse errors ([#710](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/710))

- Review API docs ([#744](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/744))

### Features

- Support history from JSON ([#743](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/743))
- Improve activity registration and proxy types ([#742](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/742))

  - Closes #655
  - Deprecates `ActivityInterface` - replaced with `UntypedActivities`
  - `proxyActivities` and (the experimental) `proxyLocalActivities` signature changed to provide better type safety when referencing non-existing activities
  - `WorkerOptions.activities` type is now `object` to allow arbitrary class registration

  NOTE: This is **not** a backwards incompatible change

- Revise SDK log attributes and levels ([#750](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/750))

  Adds 2 new default interceptors: `WorkflowInboundLogInterceptor` and `ActivityInboundLogInterceptor` and a default
  logger sink to provide better logging experience out of the box.

  Also reduced the severity of internal SDK logs to `trace` level to reduce log noise.

  Closes [#461](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/461)

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Remove unused deps; Upgrade protobufjs; Publish src ([#719](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/719))

- Add more build artifacts for debugging ([#749](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/749))

## [1.0.0-rc.0] - 2022-06-17

### Bug Fixes

- :boom: Use firstExecutionRunId and signaledRunId instead of originalRunId ([#664](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/664))

  `originalRunId` is a concept related to resetting workflows. None of the instances of `originalRunId` in the SDK seem to do with resetting, so they were changed to `firstExecutionRunId` and `signaledRunId` for handles returned by `WorkflowClient.start` / `@temporalio/workflow:startChild` and `WorkflowClient.signalWithStart` respectively.

- :boom: Use error constructor name as `applicationFailureInfo.type` ([#683](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/683))

  Now uses `err.constructor.name` instead of `err.name` by default, since `.name` is still 'Error' for classes that extend Error.

- Various improvements and fixes ([#660](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/660))

  - Record memory usage in stress tests
  - Run nightly at night (PST)
  - Don't block runtime loop when creating new client
  - Don't include proto converter in test workflows `index.ts` - cuts the **test** bundle size by half
  - Fix inflight activity tracking
  - Expose `WorkerStatus.numHeartbeatingActivities`
  - Handle ShutdownError by name - closes [#614](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/614)
  - Fix TS initiated activity cancellation not creating a proper `ApplicationFailure`
  - Closes [#667](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/667)

- Validate that RetryPolicy maximumAttempts is an integer ([#674](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/674))

  Added a quick check that `maximumAttempts` is a number using [`Number.isInteger()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isInteger). This check explicitly excludes numbers like 3.1415 and `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.

  `maximumAttempts` should always be an integer, doesn't make much sense for it to have a decimal component. And `maximumAttempts = 0` is the preferred alternative for `maximumAttempts = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.

- Use JSON.stringify() for non-error objects and String() for other values ([#681](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/681))
- [`workflow`] Import @temporalio/common ([#688](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/688))

  - Fixes [#687](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/687)

- [`worker`] Throw error when importing a node built-in module from a Workflow ([#689](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/689))

  - Closes [#685](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/685)

- Recreate TransportErrors in initial connection to provide better stack traces ([#693](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/693))
- [`docs`] Add links to API and other categories ([#676](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/676))
- [`docs`] `Connection.service` -> `.workflowService` ([#696](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/696))
- [`docs`] Remove maxIsolateMemoryMB ([#700](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/700))
- Don't drop details from core errors ([#705](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/705))

### Features

- [`worker`] Upgrade neon to 0.10 ([#675](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/675))
- :boom: Do not allow undefined in PayloadConverter.toPayload ([#672](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/672))

  BREAKING CHANGE: `PayloadConverter.toPayload` can no longer return `undefined`.

  NOTE: This change doesn't apply to `PayloadConverterWithEncoding.toPayload` where the function should return `undefined` to mark that the converter doesn't handle a value.

- :boom: Add upsertSearchAttributes and more ([#657](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/657))

  - Added and changed `WorkflowInfo` fields
  - Added `taskInfo` function to `@temporalio/workflow`
  - `Datetime` search attributes are converted to Date objects
  - Add `upsertSearchAttributes` Workflow function
  - Make Search Attributes always arrays

  - Fixes [#314](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/314)
  - Fixes [#445](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/445)
  - Closes [#576](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/576)
  - Closes [#357](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/357)

- :boom: Eager and lazy Connection variants + static metadata + worker shutdown refactor ([#682](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/682))

- Upgrade to latest sdk-core
- Fix test-payload-converter not awaiting on promises
- Simplify Connection metadata API and support static metadata
- Deprecate `NativeConnection.create` in favor of `connect` method
- Add lint rule: `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`
- Close `TestEnvironment.nativeConnection` in `teardown` method

  BREAKING CHANGE:

  - `Connection` constructor is no longer public, and is replaced with `async Connection.connect` and `Connection.lazy` factory methods.
  - `Connection.service` was renamed `Connection.workflowService`
  - `WorkflowClient` constructor now accepts a single options param

    BEFORE:

    ```ts
    const connection = new Connection(...);
    const client = new WorkflowClient(connection.service, options);
    ```

    AFTER:

    ```ts
    const connection = await Connection.connect(...);
    const client = new WorkflowClient({ connection, ...options });
    ```

  - Added `Connection.close` and made `Connection.client` protected

    NOTE: It is recommended to reuse `Connection` instances as much as possible.
    When done using a `Connection`, call `close()` to release any resources held by it.

  - `LOCAL_DOCKER_TARGET` constant was renamed `LOCAL_TARGET`

  - Metrics are now emitted with the `temporal_` prefix by default to be consistent with other SDKs, in the near future this can be disabled by setting `TelemetryOptions.noTemporalPrefixForMetrics` to `true`.

  - Closes [#607](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/607)
  - Closes [#677](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/677)
  - Closes [#452](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/452)

- :boom: Implement stack trace query ([#690](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/690))

  - Improved stack traces for workflows
  - Closes [#167](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/167)
  - Stack trace query works on node `>=16.14` because is depends on the [V8 promise hooks API](https://nodejs.org/api/v8.html#promise-hooks)
  - `@temporalio/worker` now depends on `source-map` and `source-map-loader`

  BREAKING CHANGE: `WorkerOptions.workflowBundle` now accepts both code and source maps

  Before:

  ```ts
  await Worker.create({
    workflowBundle: { code },
    ...rest,
  });

  // -- OR --

  await Worker.create({
    workflowBundle: { path },
    ...rest,
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  await Worker.create({
    workflowBundle: { code, sourceMap },
    ...rest
  })

  // -- OR --

  await Worker.create({
    workflowBundle: { codePath, sourceMapPath }
    ...rest
  })
  ```

  The return value of `bundleWorkflowCode` is now `{ code: string, sourceMap: string }`

  BREAKING CHANGE: `WorkflowInternalsInterceptor.activate` is now synchronous

- Support Jest mock Activity functions ([#704](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/704))
- [`worker`] Add `runUntil` method ([#703](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/703))

  Useful helper especially in tests.

  Usage:

  ```ts
  const worker = await Worker.create(opts);

  // Wait on an async function
  await worker.runUntil(async () => {
    client.execute(someWorkflow, wopts);
  });

  // -- OR --

  // Wait on a promise
  await worker.runUntil(client.execute(someWorkflow, wopts));
  ```

- :boom: [`worker`] Rename headers to metadata for `NativeConnection` ([#706](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/706))

  To use the same term as `@temporalio/client.Connection`

  BREAKING CHANGE:

  - `NativeConnectionOptions.headers` was renamed to `NativeConnectionOptions.metadata`
  - `NativeConnection.updateHeaders` was renamed to `NativeConnection.updateMetadata`

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Address feedback from connection refactor PR ([#686](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/686))
- Upgrade to latest Core ([#701](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/701))

  - Closes [#697](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/697)

- [`activity`] Fix Activity resolved as cancelled in unsupported situations ([#640](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/640))
- [`workflow`] Propagate scope cancellation while waiting on ExternalWorkflowHandle cancellation ([#633](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/633))
- :boom: Improve Payload Converter logic ([#558](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/558))

  BREAKING CHANGE:

  - `PayloadConverter.toPayload(value)` now returns `undefined` when `value` is not of a supported type.
  - The SDK now throws when it receives `undefined` from `toPayload`

### Features

- :boom: Allow for multiple `DataConverter.payloadCodecs` ([#643](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/643))

  BREAKING CHANGE: `DataConverter.payloadCodec` was changed to plural:

  ```ts
  export interface DataConverter {
    ...
    payloadCodecs?: PayloadCodec[];
  }
  ```

- [`worker`] Support HTTP headers in `NativeConnection` ([#644](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/644))
- :boom: [`worker`] Restructure `TelemetryOptions` ([#646](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/646))
  - Also support passing HTTP headers to an OpenTelemetry Collector
  - See the updated interface [here](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/6c9730bb5c1299885481fe3cf345001900398fd9/packages/core-bridge/index.d.ts#L123)

- Fix activity heartbeat timeout crashing nightly ([#641](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/641))

## [0.22.0] - 2022-05-02

### Bug Fixes

- [`bundler`] Fix bundler edge cases on Windows ([#619](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/619))
- [`workflow`] Fail workflow task instead of run on workflow not found ([#622](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/622))

  NOTE: This could be considered backwards incompatible if you were relying on this behavior.
  The new behavior is safer because Temporal will automatically retry these Workflows.

- [`workflow`] Fix case where activity or timer would try to be cancelled without being scheduled ([#621](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/621))
- Do not patch global object in otel runtime if not in workflow context ([#626](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/626))
- [`core`] Update Core to receive recent fixes ([#627](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/627))

- :boom: [`worker`]: Move shutdownSignals to RuntimeOptions ([#611](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/611))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Move `shutdownSignals` from `WorkerOptions` to [`RuntimeOptions`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.runtimeoptions/):

  ```ts
  // old
  Worker.create({ shutdownSignals: ['SIGINT'], ... })

  // new
  Runtime.install({ shutdownSignals: ['SIGINT'], ... })
  ```

- [`workflow`] Allow signal handlers to be cleared ([#613](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/613))

### Documentation

- Add activation sequence diagram ([#605](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/605))
- Make snipsync pull from samples-typescript ([#623](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/623))

### Refactor

- :boom: [`proto`] Use protobufjs json-modules ([#551](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/551))

  BREAKING CHANGE: The `@temporalio/proto` package no longer has files `lib/coresdk` and `lib/temporal`. Any imports from those files must be updated:

  ```ts
  // old
  import type { coresdk } from '@temporalio/proto/lib/coresdk';

  // new
  import type { coresdk } from '@temporalio/proto';
  ```

### Testing

- Add more load test scenarios to CI ([#615](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/615))
- Add some additional options to the load test worker script ([#624](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/624))

## [0.21.1] - 2022-04-21

### Bug Fixes

- [`core`] Fix worker responding with empty commands during query of uncached workflow ([#602](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/602))

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- [`deps`] Update dependency typedoc to ^0.22.0 (main) ([#578](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/578))

## [0.21.0] - 2022-04-20

### Bug Fixes

- Update Core with fix where workflows could get stuck if queried and not in cache ([#599](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/599))

### Features

- Complete test framework ([#547](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/547))

  - Add `NativeConnection.close()` method for explicitly closing a
    connection - before this change NativeConnection would be invalidated
    when all Workers are shutdown because their Runtime would implicitly
    be shutdown.

- :boom: Implement local activities ([#585](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/585))

  - BREAKING CHANGE: `ActivityOptions` no longer accepts `namespace`
  - NOTE: This feature is considered experimental and requires some time in production before considered stable

### Testing

- Verify that workflow is not retried if it throws non retryable failure ([#596](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/596))

## [0.20.2] - 2022-04-14

### Bug Fixes

- [`core`] Don't eat up a workflow task permit if when evicting a missing run ([#598](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/598))
- Compile linux binary linked to older glibc ([#590](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/590))

### Features

  Original work started in ([#525](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/525)) and was reverted.

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- [`deps`] Update dependency @svgr/webpack to v6 (main) ([#575](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/575))

## [0.20.1] - 2022-04-12

### Bug Fixes

- [`worker`] Update Core submodule to receive fix for potential deadlock ([#583](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/583))

  This is a critical fix. Without it, Workers might get "stuck" with no apparent symptoms.

### Features

- [`worker`] Cancel activities on shutdown ([#579](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/579))

  Before this change, Activities were oblivious to Worker shutdown. With this change, Activities are notified
  via cancellation when their Worker is shutdown. It is up to the Activity implementor to handle cancellation.

- [`worker`] Add Worker.getStatus() method ([#581](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/581))

  Helper for exposing the overall status of a Worker. Useful for troubleshooting problems and observability.

### Documentation

- Update workflow interceptors API reference ([#563](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/563))

## [0.20.0] - 2022-04-06

  - Implements the Worker part of [proposal #56](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/blob/050825aba0e2e6cde91bae81945dce082bd47622/typescript/connections.md)
  - Break down `Core` into `Runtime` and `NativeConnection`
  - Workers now require a `NativeConnection` instance instead of using the singleton `Core` connection
  - By default Core logs are not forwarded into node anymore
  - Various [bug fixes and features](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/compare/85454935e39f789aaaa81f8a05773f8e2cdbcde2...dcae3d6fd66fb22f727ffa14da100f0c08b6a2c8) from updating `sdk-core`

  Before:

  ```ts
  import { Core, Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';

  await Core.install({
    telemetryOptions: ...
    logger: ...
    serverOptions: {
      address: ...
      namespace: ...
    }
  });

  // Worker uses connection of singleton Core
  await Worker.create({
    taskQueue: ...,
    ...
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  import { Runtime, NativeConnection, Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';

  Runtime.install({
    telemetryOptions: ...
    logger: ...
  });

  const connection = await NativeConnection.create({
    address: ...
  });

  await Worker.create({
    connection,
    namespace: ...
    taskQueue: ...,
    ...
  });
  ```

- Use `JsonPayloadConverter` for search attributes ([#546](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/546))
  - Temporal doesn't support Null or Binary Payloads for search attributes.
- [`worker`] Fix Windows bundle-writing bug ([#554](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/554))
  - Sometimes on Windows in CI, we were getting empty Workflow bundles.

### Features

### Bug Fixes

- :boom: [`worker`] Mark activity errors retryable ([#522](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/522))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Before this fix, the `ApplicationFailures` returned by the Worker in these
  two circumstances were not retryable:

  - Activity not found
  - Failed to parse Activity args

- [`worker`] Enhance and fix heartbeat behavior ([#523](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/523))

  - Flush last heartbeat on Activity failure
  - Ensure ordering of heartbeats when custom payload codec is used
  - Discard heartbeats if activity sends them faster than payload codec
    can process them
  - Make heartbeat details codec errors fail the activity

- Update `TLSConfig` import location ([#518](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/518))
- Use default data converter for search attributes ([#511](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/511))
- Add `reason` to cancellation tasks in tests ([#526](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/526))
- [`client`] Add interceptor for `handle.describe` ([#484](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/484), thanks to [`@andreasasprou`](https://github.com/andreasasprou) 🙏)
- [`workflow`] Properly wait for vm microtasks ([#524](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/524))
  - Use `microtaskMode=afterEvaluate` to ensure `isolateExecutionTimeoutMs` includes microtask processing too.

### Features

- :boom: [`client`] Return a friendly type from `handle.describe()` ([#532](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/532))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Before this fix, [`WorkflowHandle#describe`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle#describe) returned the gRPC response [`temporal.api.workflowservice.v1.IDescribeWorkflowExecutionResponse`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/proto.temporal.api.workflowservice.v1.IDescribeWorkflowExecutionResponse). It now returns a [`WorkflowExecutionDescription`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowExecutionDescription).

  - Closes [#482](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/482)

- [`worker`] Use `swc-loader` instead of `ts-loader` ([#525](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/525), thank you [@julianocomg](https://github.com/julianocomg) 🙏)
- [`client`] Add methods to set grpc metadata and deadline for service calls ([#513](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/513))
- [`client`] Minor connection improvements ([#533](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/533))
  - Upgrade grpc-js dependency to ^1.5.7
  - Export `*` from `grpc-retry`
  - Use more exact type for `ConnectionOptions.channelArgs`
  - Set `grpc.default_authority` channel arg if `serverNameOverride` is
    provided (closes [#455](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/455))

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Get static checking of encoding Failures and Completions ([#520](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/520))
- Make forks work with sdk-features ([#502](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/502))
- Update otel packages ([#515](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/515))

### Documentation

- Fix order in publishing script ([#510](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/510))
- Update docusaurus ([#512](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/512))
- Add undefined to supported data types ([#517](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/517))
- Surface RequiredTelemetryOptions for API docs ([#527](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/527))

## [0.19.0-rc.1] - 2022-03-02

### Features

- :boom: Custom and protobuf data converters ([#477](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/477))

  BREAKING CHANGE: [`DataConverter`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.DataConverter) interface has changed, and some things that were exported from `common` no longer are. If it's no longer exported (see [list of exports](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/common)), try importing from `@temporalio/activity|client|worker|workflow`. If you're unable to find it, open an issue for us to fix it, and in the meantime import from [`internal-workflow-common`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/tree/main/packages/common/lib/internal-workflow) or [`internal-non-workflow-common`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/tree/main/packages/common/lib/internal-non-workflow).

  - Adds custom data converter feature and changes the DataConverter API. Design doc: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/tree/main/docs/data-converter.md#decision

    ```ts
    interface DataConverter {
      payloadConverterPath?: string;
      payloadCodec?: PayloadCodec;
    }

    interface PayloadConverter {
      toPayload<T>(value: T): Payload | undefined;
      fromPayload<T>(payload: Payload): T;
    }

    interface PayloadCodec {
      encode(payloads: Payload[]): Promise<Payload[]>;
      decode(payloads: Payload[]): Promise<Payload[]>;
    }
    ```

    Note: Codec is not yet run on Payloads in interceptor headers.

  - Separated `common` package into:
    ```
    common
    internal-workflow-common
    internal-non-workflow-common
    ```
    The new `common` only exports things you might want to use in your own common code (shared between client/worker/workflow) like data converters, failures, and errors. The default exports of `common` and `internal-workflow-common` are included in the Workflow bundle.
  - Unreverts [#430](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/430) and modified the Protobuf data converter API: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/tree/main/docs/protobuf-libraries.md#current-solution
  - Make `assert` available to Workflows.
  - Closes [#130](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/130)
  - Closes [#237](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/237)
  - Closes [#434](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/434)

### Bug Fixes

- Re-export possibly-shared-use things in common (#509)

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Fix linting on test-otel ([#504](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/504))

### Documentation

- Add info to publishing notes ([#503](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/503))
- Link to source proto; improve Publishing ([#507](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/507))

## [0.19.0-rc.0] - 2022-02-25

### Bug Fixes

- :boom: [`workflow-bundler`] Enable resolution of modules in Webpack based on Node's regular algorithm ([#498](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/498), thank you [@mjameswh](https://github.com/mjameswh) 🙏)

  BREAKING CHANGE: [`Worker.create`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker#create) no longer takes `nodeModulesPaths`. Instead, it resolves modules like Node does, relative to [`workflowsPath`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#workflowspath).

  This fixes [#489](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/489) and may fix issues with monorepos.

- [`workflow`] Fix ContinueAsNew error message and name ([#487](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/487))

  - Treat ContinueAsNew as success in otel interceptor span status

- [`workflow-bundler`] Improve resolving of webpack's `ts-loader` ([#492](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/492), thank you [@jameslnewell](https://github.com/jameslnewell) 🙏)
  - Addresses issues where it's not found in complex workspaces like a yarn workspaces monorepo
- Remove `console.log` emitted from core bridge ([#500](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/500))

### Documentation

- Link to `building.md` from `# Publishing` section ([#479](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/479))
- Specify default Workflow Execution retry behavior ([#495](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/495))
- Add breaking change notice to `CHANGELOG` for `v0.18.0` ([#494](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/494))
  - Closes [#493](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/493)
- Remove inaccurate `startChild` typedoc notes ([#448](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/448))

### Testing

- Add integration with sdk-features repo ([#453](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/453))
- Pass repo into sdk-features workflow ([#486](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/486))

## [0.18.0] - 2022-02-10

### Bug Fixes

- :boom: Improve failure details ([#467](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/467))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Most `failure.message` fields are no longer prefixed with `'Error: '`, so places in which you're checking `failure.message === 'Error: a message'` likely need to be changed to `failure.message === 'a message'`.

- [`workflow`] Fix startChild options type ([#447](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/447))
- [`workflow`] Fix error when timer is cancelled and immediately fired in the same activation ([#466](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/466))

- Upgrade Core to receive recent fixes ([#475](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/475))

  - Replay mock client wasn't allowing completes ([sdk-core#269](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/269))
  - Fix heartbeats not flushing on activity completion ([sdk-core#266](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/266))

- Don't register errors more than once, allowing for multiple module imports w/o panic ([#474](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/474))

### Features

- :boom: [`client`] Use `runId` only in handles created with `getHandle` ([#468](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/468))

  - In addition:
    - Adds safety to `terminate` and `cancel` so handles created with `start` can't accidentally affect workflows that are not part of the same execution chain
    - Adds optional `firstExecutionRunId` param to `getHandle` for added safety
  - Closes [#464](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/464)
  - Closes [#377](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/377)
  - Closes [#365](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/365)

  BREAKING CHANGE: Some gRPC errors are no longer being thrown from `WorkflowClient`. These errors are thrown in their place: [`WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.workflowexecutionalreadystartederror/) and [`WorkflowNotFoundError`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.workflownotfounderror/). This means that, for example, code like this:

  ```ts
  try {
    await client.start(example, { workflowId: '123' });
  } catch (e: any) {
    if (e.code === ALREADY_EXISTS) {
      console.log('Already started workflow 123');
    }
  }
  ```

  Needs to be changed to:

  ```ts
  import { WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError } from '@temporalio/common';

  try {
    await client.start(example, { workflowId: '123' });
  } catch (e: any) {
    if (e instanceof WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError) {
      console.log('Already started workflow 123');
    }
  }
  ```

- Replay history from files ([#449](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/449))
  - Provides a way to exercise existing histories against local workflow code. See [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN5bIL7wc5M) and [sample code](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/pull/99).
- [`core`] Make Core portable ([#458](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/458))
  - Installing the SDK on one OS / architecture now works if used on different OS / arch.
- Accept IHistory for history replay ([#460](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/460))

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Handle proto renaming / repackaging updates from core ([#446](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/446))
- Add MakeOptional and Replace type helpers ([#401](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/401))
- Fix core-bridge main entry in package.json ([#463](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/463))

## [0.17.2] - 2021-12-28

### Bug Fixes

- Reverted ([#430](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/430)) which added protobuf payload converters

  This broke Workflows for some users who had the `assert` package installed in their `node_modules` folder.
  `proto3-json-serializer` (added in this PR) requires `assert` which transitively requires `utils` which relies on `process` being available.

## [0.17.1] - 2021-12-27

### Bug Fixes

- Fix Workflow retryable `ApplicationFailure` fails execution ([#432](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/432))

  - Makes `ApplicationFailure.retryable` fail the workflow execution and not the task as intended, this was wrongly implemented in [#429](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/429).

- Update core submodule to receive recent bugfixes ([#433](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/433))
  - Fix WFT failures sometimes getting stuck in a spam loop ([sdk-core#240](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/240))
  - Move warning message for failed activations to be only during reports ([sdk-core#242](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/242))
  - Fix double-application of an empty WFT when handling legacy queries ([sdk-core#244](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/244))

### Features

- Add Protobuf binary and JSON data converter and WorkerOptions.dataConverterPath ([#430](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/430))

  - Renamed `WorkerOptions.dataConverter` to `WorkerOptions.dataConverterPath`: path to a module with `dataConverter` named export. This is needed in order to get the run the data converter in the node worker thread.
  - Added `ProtobufBinaryDataConverter` `ProtobufJsonDataConverter` that convert protobufjs JSON modules based arguments and return types to and from Payloads.

  **IMPORTANT**:

  Workflow cannot deserialize protobuf messages yet as it still uses the default data converter - the ability to customize the workflow data converter is coming soon.

  Design notes:

  https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/docs/protobuf-libraries.md

  Other notes:

  - Other SDKs, can read protobuf payloads generated by the TypeScript SDK
  - Other SDKs, when protobuf-serializing, must include the name of the class in `payload.metadata.messageType` for the TS SDK to read
    - **This has not been implmented yet**
    - Will later be used by the UI

## [0.17.0] - 2021-12-17

### Bug Fixes

- Use bundled Workflow interceptors ([#427](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/427))

  Addresses issue [#390](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/390) where workflow interceptor modules might not be present when using pre-bundled workflow code.

### Features

- :boom: Add validation to retry policy and use a TS friendly interface everywhere ([#426](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/426))

  - `RetryOptions` was renamed `RetryPolicy`
  - client `WorkflowOptions` no longer accepts protobuf `retryPolicy` instead it has a TS `RetryPolicy` `retry` attribute

- Implement async Activity completion ([#428](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/428))

  - Activity can throw [`CompleteAsyncError`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.completeasyncerror/) to ask the worker to forget about it
  - Later on the [`AsyncCompletionClient`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.asynccompletionclient/) can be used to complete that activity

- [`workflow`] Handle unhandled rejections in workflow code ([#415](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/415))

  - Associate unhandled rejections from workflow code to a specific runId.
  - Makes the unhandled rejection behavior consistent between node 14 and 16 and propagates failure back to the user.
    Previously, in node 16 the process would crash and in node 14 we would incorrectly ignore rejections leading to unexpected workflow behavior.

- :boom: [`workflow`] Make random workflow errors retryable ([#429](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/429))

  BREAKING CHANGE: Before this change throwing an error in a Workflow
  would cause the Workflow execution to fail. After the change only the
  Workflow task fails on random errors.
  To fail the Workflow exection throw `ApplicationFailure.nonRetryable`.

  To make other error types non retryable use the
  `WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor` `execute` and `handleSignal` methods
  to catch errors thrown from the Workflow and convert them to non
  retryable failures, e.g:

  ```ts
  class WorkflowErrorInterceptor implements WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor {
    async execute(
      input: WorkflowExecuteInput,
      next: Next<WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor, 'execute'>
    ): Promise<unknown> {
      try {
        return await next(input);
      } catch (err) {
        if (err instanceof MySpecialNonRetryableError) {
          throw ApplicationFailure.nonRetryable(err.message, 'MySpecialNonRetryableError');
        }
        throw err;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  NOTE: Propagated Activity and child Workflow failures are considered non
  retryable and will fail the workflow execution.

## [0.16.4] - 2021-12-08

### Bug Fixes

- Update core to fix workflow semaphore not released on cache miss ([#424](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/424))

### Features

- Default `WorkflowHandle` generic T param to `Workflow` ([#419](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/419))

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Add comments for unused query and signal generics ([#402](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/402))
- [`docs`] Expose worker.CoreOptions ([#416](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/416))
- [`docs`] Expose BundleOptions and remove `__namedParameters` ([#404](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/404))

- Remove proto usage from workflow runtime ([#423](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/423))

  This is now possible because we're using vm instead of isolated-vm.

  - Greatly reduce workflow bundle size - SDK test bundle size went down from 2.77MB to 0.73MB
  - Step 1 in supporting custom data converter

### Testing

- Ignore github actions jobs that require secrets for external committers ([#414](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/414))

## [0.16.3] - 2021-11-29

### Bug Fixes

- [`workflow`] Fix argument wrapping in array when signaling from Workflow ([#410](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/410))

  Before this fix, signal arguments sent from a workflow would be wrapped in an array, e.g:

  ```ts
  await child.signal(someSignal, 1, '2');
  ```

  Was received in the child workflow as:

  ```ts
  wf.setHandler(someSignal, (num: number, str: string) => {
    console.log(num, str); // [1, '2'] undefined
  });
  ```

- [`core`] Upgrade Core to receive fixes to activity heartbeats ([#411](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/411))

  - Fix hang in case Activity completes after heartbeat response indicates Activity timed out.

  - Behavior was incorrect and not inline with the other SDKs.
    Heartbeats are now throttled using a timer and Core does not count on user to keep sending heartbeats in order flush them out.

    Added 2 new `WorkerOption`s to control throttling:

    - `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval`
    - `defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval`

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- [`docs`] Explain that getHandle doesn't validate workflowId ([#400](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/400))

- Don't use fs-extra in create-project ([#412](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/412))

  Fixes issue where fs-extra is incompatible with ESM as reported on slack.

## [0.16.2] - 2021-11-23 - beta

### Features

- [`worker`] Add `WorkerOptions.debugMode` to enable debugging Workflows ([#398](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/398))

## [0.16.1] - 2021-11-22 - beta-rc.1

### Features

- [`create-project`] Use chalk-template instead of chalk-cli ([#396](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/396))
  - Fixes issues where `npx @temporalio/create` fails to resolve the `chalk` executable

## [0.16.0] - 2021-11-19 - beta-rc.0

### Bug Fixes

- [`core`] Update Core w/ specifying queue kind on polling ([#389](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/389))

  - Must be specified for optimization reasons on server

- [`core`] Update Core to receive bugfixes ([#391](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/391))

  - Fix a situation where Core could get stuck polling if WFTs were repeatedly being failed
  - Do not fail Workflow if Lang (TypeScript) cancels something that's already completed (e.g. activity, timer, child workflow)
  - Fix for Core accidentally still sending commands sometimes for things that were cancelled immediately

### Features

- :boom: [`client`] Make `workflowId` required ([#387](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/387))

  Also remove `WorkflowClientOptions.workflowDefaults`.

  Reasoning:

  - Workflow IDs should represent a meaningful business ID
  - Workflow IDs can be used as an idempotency key when starting workflows from an external signal
  - `workflowDefaults` were removed because their presence made `taskQueue` optional in `WorkflowOptions`, omitting it from both the defaults and options resulted in runtime errors where we could have caught those at compile time.

  Migration:

  ```ts
  // Before
  const client = new WorkflowClient(conn.service, { workflowDefaults: { taskQueue: 'example' } });
  const handle = await client.start(myWorkflow, { args: [foo, bar] });
  // After
  const client = new WorkflowClient(conn.service);
  const handle = await client.start(myWorkflow, {
    args: [foo, bar],
    taskQueue: 'example',
    workflowId: 'a-meaningful-business-id',
  });
  ```

- Support Windows development ([#385](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/385))

  - Support was added for using and developing the SDK on Windows
  - Thanks @cons0l3 and @cretz for the contribution

- [`workflow`] Use vm instead of isolated-vm ([#264](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/264))

  - Removes the `node-gyp` dependency and speeds up installation times
  - Uses Node's built-in `AsyncLocalStorage` implementation instead of our own
  - :boom: Requires an additional workflow interceptor if using `@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry`

  ```ts
  import { WorkflowInterceptors } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import {
    OpenTelemetryInboundInterceptor,
    OpenTelemetryOutboundInterceptor,
    OpenTelemetryInternalsInterceptor,
  } from '@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry/lib/workflow';

  export const interceptors = (): WorkflowInterceptors => ({
    inbound: [new OpenTelemetryInboundInterceptor()],
    outbound: [new OpenTelemetryOutboundInterceptor()],
    // Disposes of the internal AsyncLocalStorage used for
    // the otel workflow context manager.
    internals: [new OpenTelemetryInternalsInterceptor()], // <-- new
  });
  ```

  - Unexpose the `isolatePoolSize` and `isolateExecutionTimeout` `WorkerOptions`

## [0.15.0] - 2021-11-11

### Bug Fixes

- Fix type imports ([#361](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/361))

- Update core, changes for no more WF update errors ([#366](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/366))

  Failing a Workflow task before this change could put the workflow in a stuck state.

- :boom: [`workflow`] Throw if patches are used at Workflow top level ([#369](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/369))
- :boom: [`workflow`] Cancel timer created by condition ([#372](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/372))

  Also clean up resources taken by the blocked condition.<br>
  **This change is incompatible with old Workflow histories**.

- :boom: [`workflow`] Ensure signals are always processed ([#380](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/380))

  This fixes a critical issue where the SDK was not processing history events in the right order, for example, patches and signals should always be delivered before other events in the context of a single Workflow Task.

  **This change is incompatible with old Workflow histories**.

### Features

- :boom: [`workflow`] Change condition parameter order ([#371](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/371))

  ```ts
  // Before
  const conditionIsTrue = await condition('1s', () => someBooleanVariable);
  // After
  const conditionIsTrue = await condition(() => someBooleanVariable, '1s');
  ```

- :boom: Rename ExternalDependencies to Sinks ([#370](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/370))
- Support complication on Mac for aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu ([#378](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/378))

## [0.14.0] - 2021-11-03

### Bug Fixes

- Add missing index.d.ts to published files in core-bridge package ([#347](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/347))
- [`docs`] Update algolia index name ([#350](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/350))
- [`core`] Update core to gain infinite poll retries ([#355](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/355))
- [`worker`] Fix Worker possible hang after graceful shutdown period expires ([#356](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/356))

### Features

- :boom: [`workflow`] Rename `createActivityHandle` to `proxyActivities` ([#351](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/351))
- The function's usage remains the same, only the name was changed.

  Before:

  ```ts
  import { createActivityHandle } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import type * as activities from './activities';

  const { greet } = createActivityHandle<typeof activities>({
    startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  import { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import type * as activities from './activities';

  const { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
    startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
  });
  ```

  Reasoning:

  - Clarify that the method returns a proxy
  - Avoid confusion with `WorkflowHandle`

- :boom: [`workflow`] Rename `setListener` to `setHandler` ([#352](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/352))

  BREAKING CHANGE: The function's usage remains the same, only the name was changed.

  Before:

  ```ts
  import { defineSignal, setListener, condition } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import { unblockSignal } from './definitions';

  export const unblockSignal = defineSignal('unblock');

  export async function myWorkflow() {
    let isBlocked = true;
    setListener(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));
    await condition(() => !isBlocked);
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  import { defineSignal, setHandler, condition } from '@temporalio/workflow';
  import { unblockSignal } from './definitions';

  export const unblockSignal = defineSignal('unblock');

  export async function myWorkflow() {
    let isBlocked = true;
    setHandler(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));
    await condition(() => !isBlocked);
  }
  ```

  Reasoning:

  - It was our go-to name initially but we decided against it when to avoid confusion with the `WorkflowHandle` concept
  - Handling seems more accurate about what the function is doing than listening
  - With listeners it sounds like you can set multiple listeners, and handler doesn't

- [`worker`] Add SIGUSR2 to default list of shutdown signals ([#346](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/346))
- :boom: [`client`] Use failure classes for WorkflowClient errors

  - Error handling for `WorkflowClient` and `WorkflowHandle` `execute` and `result` methods now throw
    `WorkflowFailedError` with the specific `TemporalFailure` as the cause.
    The following error classes were renamed:

    - `WorkflowExecutionFailedError` was renamed `WorkflowFailedError`.
    - `WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNewError` was renamed
      `WorkflowContinuedAsNewError`.

  Before:

  ```ts
  try {
    await WorkflowClient.execute(myWorkflow, { taskQueue: 'example' });
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof WorkflowExecutionFailedError && err.cause instanceof ApplicationFailure) {
      console.log('Workflow failed');
    } else if (err instanceof WorkflowExecutionTimedOutError) {
      console.log('Workflow timed out');
    } else if (err instanceof WorkflowExecutionTerminatedError) {
      console.log('Workflow terminated');
    } else if (err instanceof WorkflowExecutionCancelledError) {
      console.log('Workflow cancelled');
    }
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  try {
    await WorkflowClient.execute(myWorkflow, { taskQueue: 'example' });
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof WorkflowFailedError) {
    ) {
      if (err.cause instanceof ApplicationFailure) {
        console.log('Workflow failed');
      } else if (err.cause instanceof TimeoutFailure) {
        console.log('Workflow timed out');
      } else if (err.cause instanceof TerminatedFailure) {
        console.log('Workflow terminated');
      } else if (err.cause instanceof CancelledFailure) {
        console.log('Workflow cancelled');
      }
  }
  ```

    immediately starts the Workflow
  - `wf.executeChild` replaces `ChildWorkflowHandle.execute`
  - `wf.createExternalWorkflowHandle` was renamed to
    `wf.getExternalWorkflowHandle`

  export const unblockSignal = wf.defineSignal('unblock');
  export const isBlockedQuery = wf.defineQuery<boolean>('isBlocked');

  export async function myWorkflow(arg1: number, arg2: string): Promise<void> {
    let isBlocked = true;
    wf.setListener(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));
    wf.setListener(isBlockedQuery, () => isBlocked);
    await wf.condition(() => !isBlocked);
  }
  ```
