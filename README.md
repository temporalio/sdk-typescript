[Temporal](https://temporal.io) is a microservice orchestration platform that enables developers to build scalable applications without sacrificing productivity or reliability. Temporal Server executes units of application logicâ€”Workflowsâ€”in a resilient manner that automatically handles intermittent failures and retries failed operations.

Temporal is a mature technologyâ€”it's a fork of Uber's Cadence. Temporal is being developed by Temporal Technologies, a startup by the creators of Cadence.
