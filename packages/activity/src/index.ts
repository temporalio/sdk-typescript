/**
 * This library provides tools for authoring activities.
 *
 * Import this module from Activity code - must **not** be used in Workflows.
 *
 * Any function can be used as an Activity as long as its parameters and return value are serialiable using a [`DataConverter`](../interfaces/worker.dataconverter.md).
 *
 * ### Cancellation
 * Activities may be cancelled only if they [emit heartbeats](../classes/activity.context.md#heartbeat).<br/>
 * There are 2 ways to handle Activity cancellation:
 * 1. await on [`Context.current().cancelled`](../classes/activity.context.md#cancelled)
 * 1. Pass the context's [abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) at [`Context.current().cancellationSignal`](../classes/activity.context.md#cancellationsignal) to a library that supports it
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * #### An Activity that fakes progress and can be cancelled
 *
 * <!--SNIPSTART nodejs-activity-fake-progress-->
 * <!--SNIPEND-->
 *
 * #### An Activity that makes a cancellable HTTP request
 * ```ts
 * import fetch from 'node-fetch';
 * import { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';
 *
 * export async function cancellableFetch(url: string): Promise<Uint8Array> {
 *   const response = await fetch(url, { signal: Context.current().cancellationSignal });
 *   const contentLengthHeader = response.headers.get('Content-Length');
 *   if (contentLengthHeader === null) {
 *     throw new Error('expected Content-Length header to be set');
 *   }
 *   const contentLength = parseInt(contentLengthHeader);
 *   let bytesRead = 0;
 *   const chunks: Buffer[] = [];

 *   for await (const chunk of response.body) {
 *     if (!(chunk instanceof Buffer)) {
 *       throw new TypeError('Expected Buffer');
 *     }
 *     bytesRead += chunk.length;
 *     chunks.push(chunk);
 *     Context.current().heartbeat(bytesRead / contentLength);
 *   }
 *   return Buffer.concat(chunks);
 * }
 * ```
 * @module
