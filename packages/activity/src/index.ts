/**
 * This library provides tools for authoring activities.
 *
 * Import this module from Activity code - must **not** be used in Workflows.
 *
 * Any function can be used as an Activity as long as its parameters and return value are serialiable using a [`DataConverter`](../interfaces/worker.DataConverter.md).
 *
 * ### Cancellation
 * Activities may be cancelled only if they [emit heartbeats](../classes/activity.Context.md#heartbeat).<br/>
 * There are 2 ways to handle Activity cancellation:
 * 1. await on [`Context.current().cancelled`](../classes/activity.Context.md#cancelled)
 * 1. Pass the context's [abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) at [`Context.current().cancellationSignal`](../classes/activity.Context.md#cancellationsignal) to a library that supports it
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * #### An Activity that fakes progress and can be cancelled
 *
 * <!--SNIPSTART nodejs-activity-fake-progress-->
 * <!--SNIPEND-->
 *
 * #### An Activity that makes a cancellable HTTP request
 *
 * <!--SNIPSTART nodejs-activity-cancellable-fetch-->
 * <!--SNIPEND-->
