   *
   * ### Threading model
   *
   * All interactions with Core SDK (including polling for Workflow Activations and sending back completion results)

   *
   * **When `reuseV8Context` is disabled**, a new VM context is created for each Workflow handled by the Worker.
   * Creating a new VM context is a relatively lengthy operation which blocks the Node.js event loop. Using multiple
   * threads helps compensate the impact of this operation on the Worker's performance.
   *
   * **When `reuseV8Context` is enabled**, a single VM context is created for each worker thread, then reused for every
   * Workflows handled by that thread (per-Workflow objects get shuffled in and out of that context on every Workflow
   * Task). Consequently, there is generally no advantage in using multiple threads when `reuseV8Context` is enabled.
   *
   * If more than one thread is used, Workflows will be load-balanced evenly between worker threads on the first
   * Activation of a Workflow Execution, based on the number of Workflows currently owned by each worker thread;
   * futher Activations of that Workflow Execution will then be handled by the same thread, until the Workflow Execution
   * gets evicted from cache.

   * Sinks are a mechanism for exporting data out of the Workflow sandbox. They are typically used

   *
   * To prevent non-determinism issues, sink functions may not have any observable side effect on the
   * execution of a workflow. In particular, sink functions may not return values to the workflow,
   * nor throw errors to the workflow (an exception thrown from a sink function simply get logged to
   * the {@link Runtime}'s logger).
   *
   * For similar reasons, sink functions are not executed immediately when a call is made from
   * workflow code. Instead, calls are buffered until the end of the workflow activation; they get
   * executed right before returning a completion response to Core SDK. Note that the time it takes to
   * execute sink functions delays sending a completion response to the server, and may therefore
   * induce Workflow Task Timeout errors. Sink functions should thus be kept as fast as possible.
   *
   * Sink functions are always invoked in the order that calls were maded in workflow code. Note
   * however that async sink functions are not awaited individually. Consequently, sink functions that
   * internally perform async operations may end up executing concurrently.
   *
   * Please note that sink functions only provide best-effort delivery semantics, which is generally
   * suitable for log messages and general metrics collection. However, in various situations, a sink
   * function call may execute more than once even though the sink function is configured with
   * `callInReplay: false`. Similarly, sink function execution errors only results in log messages,
   * and are therefore likely to go unnoticed. For use cases that require _at-least-once_ execution
   * guarantees, please consider using local activities instead. For use cases that require
   * _exactly-once_ or _at-most-once_ execution guarantees, please consider using regular activities.
   *
   * Sink names starting with `__temporal_` are reserved for use by the SDK itself. Do not register
   * or use such sink. Registering a sink named `defaultWorkerLogger` to redirect workflow logs to a
