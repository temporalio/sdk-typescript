# [0.9.0](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/compare/@temporalio/worker@0.8.0...@temporalio/worker@0.9.0) (2021-09-15)


### Bug Fixes

* **worker:** List available activities when activity is not found by worker ([733b01e](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/commit/733b01ee9913c255cea8913222c1232bf1bda3a4))


* feat!: Use Object instead of Map for interceptor headers ([80db27d](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/commit/80db27d62bad78a71352cdc5db2b9ca49b9d1062))
* feat(workflow)!: Remove Local and Remote ActivityOptions ([d29844d](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/commit/d29844d992e61354297ca660d0b103e39001f519))
* feat(workflow)!: Process Workflow activations concurrently ([dfb1c3d](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/commit/dfb1c3dfc7eace3e8ec5d3776b4f671f6633bc57))
* feat(workflow)!: Revise Workflow API ([3467bd7](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/commit/3467bd798f5e6866412be67c0b0e645e1d66dd7f))


### Features

* Add Workflow internals interceptor ([4f20d58](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/commit/4f20d581a743de842afef51edb88be75dbec40e0))
* Export to an external OTel collector. Much easier ([7654b98](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/commit/7654b980c0d8ea061a2a3cc4454f0d367759f90a))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Interceptors now use an Object for representing headers
instead of a Map

With this change it's easier to chain interceptors without mutating the
input.
* `ActivityOptions` no longer take a `type` attribute.
`LocalActivityOptions` and `RemoteActivityOptions` interfaces have been
removed.
* Workflow histories generated by old versions of the SDK
might break with non-determinism errors.
WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor now has a `create` method to intercept
Workflow creation, the `WorkflowInput` interface was renamed
`WorkflowExecuteInput`.
* Workflow registration and invocation has been changed
- `main` has been renamed `execute`
- Workflow arguments moved from `execute` method to the Workflow factory
  function (see below)
- Workflows are now defined as named functions
  Old:
  ```ts
  // workflows/myWorkflow.ts
  export const workflow = { async main(...args) {}, /* signals, queries */ };
  ```
  New:
  ```ts
  // workflows/index.ts
  export const myWorkflow = (...args) => ({ async execute() {}, /* signals, queries */ });
  ```
- Workflow Interceptors are now instantiated via a factory function
  Old:
  ```ts
  export const interceptors = { /* ... */ };
  ```
  New:
  ```ts
  export const interceptors = () => ({ /* ... */ });
  ```
- Workflow stubs can be constructed from a registered Workflow function
  Old:
  ```ts
  const stub = client.stub<MyWorkflowInterface>('my-workflow', opts);
  ```
  New:
  ```ts
  import { myWorkflow } from './workflows';
  const stub = client.stub(myWorkflow, opts);
  ```

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `@activities` import does not work any more.
Activities registration is either done automatically with the `workDir`
option or by providing `activities` to `WorkerOptions`.

WorkflowClient and WorkflowStub now chain the Workflow error as `cause`
of `WorkflowExecutionFailedError` instead of setting the `message`
property.
