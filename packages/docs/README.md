# `@temporalio/docs`

Generates the API reference docs using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```console
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Deployment

The reference is built and deployed to Netlify under https://nodejs.temporal.io during CI for branch `main` using GitHub Actions.
