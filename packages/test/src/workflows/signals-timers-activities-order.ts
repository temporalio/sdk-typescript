/**
 * This workflow demonstrates a subtle anomaly in the ordering of async operations in
 * pre-ProcessWfActivationJobsAsSingleBatch, and confirms that ordering is now coherent after
 * introduction of that flag.
 *
 * Assuming the workflow receives the activity completion and timer completion in the same workflow
 * task, both `activityCompleted` and `timerCompleted` will be true once the workflow completes; this
 * is a desirable behavior. However, before 1.11.0, if signal also came in during that same activation,
 * then the workflow would complete with`activityCompleted` and `timerCompleted` both `false`, *even
 * though they really did completed*. The fact that all conditions and microtasks resulting from
 * incoming signals will be settled before any other type of event, while other events will all other
 * type of events will execute interleaved with each other, is something non-obvious to users.
 *
 * This can be a problem in many practical use cases, e.g. notably with some form of Entity workflows
 * (the workflow might CAN with a state that doesn't reflect the fact that some activity task has
 * completed) or saga workflows (workflow may fail to properly undo the activity because if it didn't
 * knew that it had completed).
 *
 * Note that there is no safe and easy way for users to resolve this issue by themselves in pre-1.11.0,
 * and neither would calling `wf.allHandlersFinished()` help.
