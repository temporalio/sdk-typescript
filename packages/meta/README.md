Temporal is a microservice orchestration platform which enables developers to build scalable applications without sacrificing productivity or reliability. Temporal server executes units of application logic—Workflows—in a resilient manner that automatically handles intermittent failures and retries failed operations.

Temporal is a mature technology—it's a fork of Uber's Cadence. Temporal is being developed by [Temporal Technologies](https://temporal.io), a startup by the creators of Cadence.
