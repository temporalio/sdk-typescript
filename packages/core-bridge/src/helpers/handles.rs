/// Opaque Handles are native structures that are sent into the JS side but without exposing
/// their internal structure; i.e. they are only meant to be passed back to the Rust side
/// on appropriate API calls.
///
/// Due to very different ownership models and usage patterns, and to avoid unnecessary
/// complexity, Opaque Handles are split into two variants:
///
/// - `OpaqueOutboundHandle` - for sending an opaque handle that was just created by the Rust
///                            side to the JS side (e.g. as the return value of an API call).
/// - `OpaqueInboundHandle` - for accepting an opaque handle sent from the JS side to the Rust
///                           side (e.g. as an argument to an API call).
///
/// **Internals**
/// `OpaqueOutboundHandle` owns the inner object directly (i.e. without Neon's `Handle<JsBox<â€¦>>`),
/// until it is sent to the JS side in `try_into_js`. From that point on, the inner object is
/// wrapped in a `Handle<JsBox<Rc<FinalizeWrapper<RefCell<...>>>>`, which belongs to the JS thread
/// on which it is sent to the JS side in `try_into_js`. From that point on, the inner object is
/// wrapped in a `Handle<JsBox<Rc<FinalizeWrapper<RefCell<...>>>>`, which belongs to the JS thread
/// on which it was sent. The inner object will no longer be sent across threads until the handle
/// is later disolved (see below).
///
/// `OpaqueInboundHandle` receives a reference to a `Handle<JsBox<...>>` struct from the JS side,
/// and from that, holds a temporary shared ownership of the `RefCell<...>` through the `Rc`.
/// The `OpaqueInboundHandle` can be disolved by any of these three means:
///
///  1. `OpaqueInboundHandle::take` or `OpaqueInboundHandle::try_take` explicitly; this can be
///     done for example to implement an explicit destructor for the target object, and has the
///     advantage that it allows returning a `Promise` to the JS side to await the completion
///     of the destructor.
///  2. The corresponding JS side object gets GC'ed, resulting in Neon calling `Finalize` on the
///     `JsBox`, which propagates down to the Wrapper; the `OpaqueInboundHandle` intercepts that
///     event and make it a call to `FinalizeMut` on the inner object IIF the handle has not been
///     taken already. This executes on the JS thread, but it is not possible to return a `Promise`
///     or anything else back to the JS side.
///  3. The `FinalizeWrapper` is dropped at any point, which should in theory be rare aside from
///     following the previous two scenarios. It may however happen if the `OpaqueOutboundHandle`
///     is dropped before is has been sent to JS. It has also been observed in practice in some
///     degenerate scenarios involving panics or JS threads exiting uncleanly. The `FinalizeWrapper`
///     intercepts these cases and call `FinalizeMut` on the inner object IIF the object has not
///     been taken already. This may happen on either the JS thread, or the Rust thread that created
///     the `OpaqueOutboundHandle`.
///
// FIXME(JWH): At this point, I'm now seeing how it would be possible to merge Inbound and Outbound
//             handles into a single object. To be revisited at a later point.
